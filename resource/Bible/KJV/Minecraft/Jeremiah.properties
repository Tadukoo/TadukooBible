Book16Page15=God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; &l3&rThou didst say, Woe is me now\! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. &l4&rThus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I
Book11Page29=Chapter 32\nThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. &l2&rFor then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem\: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the
Book16Page14=Chapter 45\nThe word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, &l2&rThus saith the LORD, the
Book11Page28=the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
Book16Page13=as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.
Book11Page27=measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. &l40&rAnd the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward
Book16Page12=I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil\: &l30&rThus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life;
Book11Page26=beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD. &l38&rBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. &l39&rAnd the
Book16Page11=return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs. &l29&rAnd this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that
Book11Page25=&l36&rIf those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. &l37&rThus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out
Book16Page10=&l27&rBehold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good\: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. &l28&rYet a small number that escape the sword shall
Book11Page24=will remember their sin no more. &l35&rThus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name\:
Book11Page23=people. &l34&rAnd they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD\: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD\: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I
Book11Page22=them, saith the LORD\: &l33&rBut this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my
Book11Page21=house of Israel, and with the house of Judah\: &l32&rNot according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto
Book11Page20=grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. &l30&rBut every one shall die for his own iniquity\: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. &l31&rBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the
Book11Page19=as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD. &l29&rIn those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour
Book11Page18=this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me. &l27&rBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. &l28&rAnd it shall come to pass, that like
Book11Page17=mountain of holiness. &l24&rAnd there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. &l25&rFor I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. &l26&rUpon
Book11Page16=shall compass a man. &l23&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and
Book11Page15=set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest\: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. &l22&rHow long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman
Book11Page14=Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still\: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD. &l21&rSet thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps\:
Book11Page13=and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God. &l19&rSurely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh\: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. &l20&rIs
Book11Page12=there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border. &l18&rI have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke\: turn thou me,
Book11Page11=to be comforted for her children, because they were not. &l16&rThus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears\: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. &l17&rAnd
Book11Page10=&l14&rAnd I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD. &l15&rThus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused
Book14Page9=prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD\: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me. &l15&rThen Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death?
Book14Page8=rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. &l13&rSo they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon\: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. &l14&rThen Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the
Book14Page7=and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. &l12&rAnd Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and
Book14Page6=is\: for there is no more bread in the city. &l10&rThen the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. &l11&rSo Ebedmelech took the men with him,
Book14Page5=forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying, &l9&rMy lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he
Book14Page4=water, but mire\: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire. &l7&rNow when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; &l8&rEbedmelech went
Book14Page3=king is not he that can do any thing against you. &l6&rThen took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison\: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no
Book14Page2=hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them\: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. &l5&rThen Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand\: for the
Book14Page1=Chapter 38 Cont.\nThus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it. &l4&rTherefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death\: for thus he weakeneth the
Book2Page50=not at all ashamed, neither could they blush\: therefore they shall fall among them that fall\: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
Book4Page9=because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out. &l20&rYet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.
Book4Page8=they may come\: &l18&rAnd let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. &l19&rFor a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled\! we are greatly confounded,
Book4Page7=heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known\: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. &l17&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that
Book4Page6=after Baalim, which their fathers taught them\: &l15&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. &l16&rI will scatter them also among the
Book2Page49=prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. &l14&rThey have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. &l15&rWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were
Book4Page5=like a wilderness, that none passeth through? &l13&rAnd the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; &l14&rBut have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and
Book15Page50=women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, &l16&rAs for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.
Book2Page48=turned unto others, with their fields and wives together\: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. &l13&rFor from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the
Book4Page4=dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant. &l12&rWho is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up
Book2Page47=of the LORD; I am weary with holding in\: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together\: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. &l12&rAnd their houses shall be
Book4Page3=wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone. &l11&rAnd I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of
Book2Page46=baskets. &l10&rTo whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken\: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. &l11&rTherefore I am full of the fury
Book4Page2=his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. &l9&rShall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD\: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? &l10&rFor the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the
Book2Page45=thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. &l9&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine\: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the
Book4Page1=Chapter 9 Cont.\nTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? &l8&rTheir tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit\: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with
Book2Page44=Jerusalem\: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. &l7&rAs a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness\: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds. &l8&rBe
Book2Page43=up at noon. Woe unto us\! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. &l5&rArise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. &l6&rFor thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against
Book2Page42=daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman. &l3&rThe shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place. &l4&rPrepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go
Book2Page41=Chapter 6\nO ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem\: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. &l2&rI have likened the
Book2Page40=nation as this? &l30&rA wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; &l31&rThe prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so\: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
Book15Page49=that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there\: for none shall return but such as shall escape. &l15&rThen all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the
Book15Page48=will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence\: &l14&rSo that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain,
Book15Page47=land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine\: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine\: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. &l13&rFor I
Book15Page46=God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. &l12&rAnd I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the
Book15Page45=of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? &l10&rThey are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. &l11&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
Book15Page44=the nations of the earth? &l9&rHave ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land
Book15Page43=none to remain; &l8&rIn that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all
Book15Page42=are wasted and desolate, as at this day. &l7&rTherefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you
Book15Page41=&l5&rBut they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. &l6&rWherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they
Book2Page39=they overpass the deeds of the wicked\: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. &l29&rShall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD\: shall not my soul be avenged on such a
Book15Page40=they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. &l4&rHowbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
Book2Page38=found wicked men\: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. &l27&rAs a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit\: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. &l28&rThey are waxen fat, they shine\: yea,
Book2Page37=giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season\: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest. &l25&rYour iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you. &l26&rFor among my people are
Book2Page36=themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? &l23&rBut this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. &l24&rNeither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that
Book2Page35=see not; which have ears, and hear not\: &l22&rFear ye not me? saith the LORD\: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it\: and though the waves thereof toss
Book2Page34=and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. &l20&rDeclare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, &l21&rHear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and
Book2Page33=&l18&rNevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you. &l19&rAnd it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me,
Book2Page32=thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat\: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds\: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees\: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
Book2Page31=house of Israel, saith the LORD\: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. &l16&rTheir quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. &l17&rAnd they shall eat up
Book2Page30=shall it be done unto them. &l14&rWherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. &l15&rLo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O
Book15Page39=seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein, &l3&rBecause of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that
Book15Page38=Chapter 44\nThe word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, &l2&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have
Book15Page37=&l13&rHe shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
Book15Page36=&l12&rAnd I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives\: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
Book15Page35=hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. &l11&rAnd when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
Book15Page34=in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; &l10&rAnd say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have
Book15Page33=not the voice of the LORD\: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. &l8&rThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, &l9&rTake great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house
Book15Page32=the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. &l7&rSo they came into the land of Egypt\: for they obeyed
Book15Page31=of Judah. &l5&rBut Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; &l6&rEven men, and women, and children, and
Book2Page29=very treacherously against me, saith the LORD. &l12&rThey have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine\: &l13&rAnd the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them\: thus
Book15Page30=us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. &l4&rSo Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land
Book2Page28=LORD\: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? &l10&rGo ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end\: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD'S. &l11&rFor the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt
Book2Page27=had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. &l8&rThey were as fed horses in the morning\: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife. &l9&rShall I not visit for these things? saith the
Book2Page26=cities\: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces\: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased. &l7&rHow shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods\: when I
Book2Page25=known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God\: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. &l6&rWherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their
Book2Page24=than a rock; they have refused to return. &l4&rTherefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish\: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God. &l5&rI will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have
Book2Page23=say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely. &l3&rO LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction\: they have made their faces harder
Book2Page22=Chapter 5\nRun ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it. &l2&rAnd though they
Book2Page21=woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now\! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
Book2Page20=clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life. &l31&rFor I have heard a voice as of a
Book15Page29=and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely\: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there\: &l3&rBut Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver
Book15Page28=Chapter 43\nAnd it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words, &l2&rThen spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah,
Book15Page27=that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.
Book15Page26=LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it. &l21&rAnd now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you. &l22&rNow therefore know certainly
Book15Page25=you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt\: know certainly that I have admonished you this day. &l20&rFor ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the
Book15Page24=inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt\: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. &l19&rThe LORD hath said concerning
Book15Page23=die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence\: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. &l18&rFor thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the
Book15Page22=overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. &l17&rSo shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall
Book15Page21=therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; &l16&rThen it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall
Book2Page19=&l29&rThe whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks\: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. &l30&rAnd when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
Book15Page20=not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, &l14&rSaying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell\: &l15&rAnd now
Book2Page18=LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. &l28&rFor this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black\: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
Book2Page17=and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. &l26&rI beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. &l27&rFor thus hath the
Book15Page9=with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought

Book15Page4=fear of Baasha king of Israel\: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. &l10&rThen Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in
Book2Page11=whirlwind\: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us\! for we are spoiled. &l14&rO Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? &l15&rFor a voice declareth from Dan, and
Book15Page3=wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. &l9&rNow the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for

Book15Page17=the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, &l9&rAnd said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before
Book15Page16=we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God. &l7&rAnd it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah. &l8&rThen called he Johanan

Book6Page47=day of their calamity. &l18&rThen said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us
Book6Page46=cast up; &l16&rTo make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head. &l17&rI will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the

Book6Page42=do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them. &l11&rNow therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame
Book6Page41=&l8&rIf that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. &l9&rAnd at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; &l10&rIf it

Book16Page6=&l23&rBecause ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.
Book16Page5=&l22&rSo that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.

Book19Page36=carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons\: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. &l31&rAnd it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the

Book19Page23=&l12&rNow in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, &l13&rAnd burned the house of the LORD,

Book10Page7=come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him. &l10&rThen Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. &l11&rAnd Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus
Book13Page33=them; but they hearkened not. &l32&rThen took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire\: and there
Book5Page16=inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. &l14&rAnd I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith
Book5Page15=saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine\: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? &l13&rThen shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the
Book13Page32=the heat, and in the night to the frost. &l31&rAnd I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against
Book10Page6=&l8&rThe prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. &l9&rThe prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall
Book10Page5=which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. &l7&rNevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;
Book13Page31=certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? &l30&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David\: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to
Book5Page14=unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory\: but they would not hear. &l12&rTherefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus
Book5Page13=words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. &l11&rFor as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave
Book13Page30=words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. &l29&rAnd thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall
Book10Page4=&l5&rThen the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, &l6&rEven the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen\: the LORD do so\: the LORD perform thy words
Book5Page12=was marred, it was profitable for nothing. &l8&rThen the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l9&rThus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. &l10&rThis evil people, which refuse to hear my
Book10Page3=from this place, and carried them to Babylon\: &l4&rAnd I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD\: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Book5Page11=many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there. &l7&rThen I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it\: and, behold, the girdle
Book10Page2=&l2&rThus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. &l3&rWithin two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away
Book5Page10=second time, saying, &l4&rTake the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. &l5&rSo I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me. &l6&rAnd it came to pass after
Book10Page1=Chapter 28 Cont.\nAnd it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
Book13Page29=prophet\: but the LORD hid them. &l27&rThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, &l28&rTake thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
Book13Page28=intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll\: but he would not hear them. &l26&rBut the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the
Book13Page27=the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. &l24&rYet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. &l25&rNevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
Book13Page26=the winterhouse in the ninth month\: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all
Book13Page25=ears of the king. &l21&rSo the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll\: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. &l22&rNow the king sat in
Book13Page24=&l19&rThen said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. &l20&rAnd they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the
Book13Page23=king of all these words. &l17&rAnd they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? &l18&rThen Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
Book13Page22=them. &l15&rAnd they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. &l16&rNow it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the
Book13Page21=sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto
Book13Page20=Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. &l13&rThen Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. &l14&rTherefore all the princes
Book13Page19=Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, &l12&rThen he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber\: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of
Book13Page18=of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people. &l11&rWhen Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of
Book13Page17=Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. &l10&rThen read Baruch in the book the words
Book13Page16=that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. &l8&rAnd Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house. &l9&rAnd it came to pass in the fifth year of
Book13Page15=the fasting day\: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. &l7&rIt may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way\: for great is the anger and the fury
Book13Page14=&l5&rAnd Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD\: &l6&rTherefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon
Book13Page13=man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. &l4&rThen Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah\: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
Book13Page12=Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. &l3&rIt may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every
Book13Page11=Chapter 36\nAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, &l2&rTake thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against
Book13Page10=God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
Book4Page50=thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee\: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
Book4Page49=run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? &l6&rFor even thy brethren, and the house of
Book17Page50=satisfied, saith the LORD. &l11&rBecause ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
Book4Page48=for the day of slaughter. &l4&rHow long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. &l5&rIf thou hast
Book4Page47=taken root\: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit\: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. &l3&rBut thou, O LORD, knowest me\: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee\: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them
Book4Page46=Chapter 12\nRighteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee\: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments\: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously? &l2&rThou hast planted them, yea, they have
Book4Page45=by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine\: &l23&rAnd there shall be no remnant of them\: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
Book11Page9=be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. &l13&rThen shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together\: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
Book4Page44=&l21&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand\: &l22&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them\: the young men shall die
Book11Page8=him that was stronger than he. &l12&rTherefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd\: and their soul shall
Book4Page43=let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. &l20&rBut, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them\: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
Book11Page7=&l10&rHear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock. &l11&rFor the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of
Book4Page42=knowledge of it, and I know it\: then thou shewedst me their doings. &l19&rBut I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and
Book11Page6=shall return thither. &l9&rThey shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them\: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble\: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
Book4Page41=hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal. &l18&rAnd the LORD hath given me
Book11Page5=people, the remnant of Israel. &l8&rBehold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together\: a great company
Book4Page40=from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. &l16&rThe LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit\: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken. &l17&rFor the LORD of
Book11Page4=watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. &l7&rFor thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations\: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy

Book17Page48=the LORD, the hope of their fathers. &l8&rRemove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. &l9&rFor, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great

Book17Page44=confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. &l3&rFor out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein\: they shall remove, they

Book4Page38=trouble. &l13&rFor according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal. &l14&rTherefore pray not thou for
Book17Page40=quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. &l37&rFor I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life\: and I will

Book4Page36=words; and they went after other gods to serve them\: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. &l11&rTherefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able

Book4Page34=unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. &l8&rYet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart\: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I

Book4Page16=people are vain\: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. &l4&rThey deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. &l5&rThey are upright as the palm
Book4Page15=Chapter 10\nHear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel\: &l2&rThus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. &l3&rFor the customs of the
Book4Page14=of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
Book4Page13=all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; &l26&rEgypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness\: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house
Book4Page12=glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth\: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD. &l25&rBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish
Book4Page11=as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them. &l23&rThus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches\: &l24&rBut let him that glorieth
Book4Page10=&l21&rFor death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets. &l22&rSpeak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and
Book17Page19=Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together. &l4&rWherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that
Book17Page18=war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire\: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. &l3&rHowl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled\: cry, ye daughters of
Book17Page17=Chapter 49\nConcerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? &l2&rTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of
Book17Page16=of Chemosh perisheth\: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. &l47&rYet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
Book17Page15=the shadow of Heshbon because of the force\: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. &l46&rWoe be unto thee, O Moab\! the people
Book17Page14=LORD. &l44&rHe that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare\: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. &l45&rThey that fled stood under
Book17Page13=that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. &l42&rAnd Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD. &l43&rFear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the
Book17Page12=be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him. &l40&rFor thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. &l41&rKerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at
Book17Page11=generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof\: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD. &l39&rThey shall howl, saying, How is it broken down\! how hath Moab turned the back with shame\! so shall Moab
Book17Page10=like pipes for the men of Kirheres\: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished. &l37&rFor every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped\: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. &l38&rThere shall be lamentation
Book12Page9=the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south\: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.
Book12Page8=beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. &l44&rMen shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of
Book12Page7=&l42&rFor thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. &l43&rAnd fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or
Book12Page6=away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. &l41&rYea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
Book12Page5=my people, and I will be their God\: &l39&rAnd I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them\: &l40&rAnd I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
Book12Page4=the pestilence; &l37&rBehold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely\: &l38&rAnd they shall be
Book12Page3=they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. &l36&rAnd now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by
Book12Page2=name, to defile it. &l35&rAnd they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that
Book12Page1=Chapter 32 Cont.\nAnd they have turned unto me the back, and not the face\: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. &l34&rBut they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my
Book8Page50=against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
Book8Page49=are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations. &l13&rAnd I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced
Book8Page48=the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. &l11&rAnd this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. &l12&rAnd it shall come to pass, when seventy years
Book8Page47=nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations. &l10&rMoreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of
Book8Page46=not heard my words, &l9&rBehold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these
Book8Page45=with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. &l7&rYet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. &l8&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have
Book8Page44=every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever\: &l6&rAnd go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger
Book8Page43=unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened. &l4&rAnd the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. &l5&rThey said, Turn ye again now
Book8Page42=people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, &l3&rFrom the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken
Book8Page41=Chapter 25\nThe word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; &l2&rThe which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the
Book8Page40=the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
Book8Page39=the land of Egypt\: &l9&rAnd I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. &l10&rAnd I will send the sword, the famine, and
Book8Page38=their whole heart. &l8&rAnd as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in
Book8Page37=land\: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. &l7&rAnd I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD\: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God\: for they shall return unto me with
Book8Page36=these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. &l6&rFor I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this
Book8Page35=LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. &l4&rAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l5&rThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like
Book8Page34=carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. &l2&rOne basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe\: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. &l3&rThen said the
Book8Page33=Chapter 24\n &l1&rThe LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the
Book8Page32=presence\: &l40&rAnd I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
Book8Page31=burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; &l39&rTherefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my
Book8Page30=God, of the LORD of hosts our God. &l37&rThus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken? &l38&rBut since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The
Book8Page29=his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? &l36&rAnd the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more\: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living
Book8Page28=then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. &l34&rAnd as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house. &l35&rThus shall ye say every one to
Book8Page27=by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them\: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD. &l33&rAnd when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt
Book8Page26=his neighbour. &l31&rBehold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. &l32&rBehold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and
Book8Page25=What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD. &l29&rIs not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? &l30&rTherefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from
Book8Page24=my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. &l28&rThe prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully.
Book8Page23=what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. &l26&rHow long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; &l27&rWhich think to cause
Book8Page22=and from the evil of their doings. &l23&rAm I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off? &l24&rCan any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. &l25&rI have heard
Book8Page21=it perfectly. &l21&rI have not sent these prophets, yet they ran\: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. &l22&rBut if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way,
Book8Page20=forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind\: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. &l20&rThe anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart\: in the latter days ye shall consider
Book12Page50=seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any\: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.
Book1Page9=round about, and against all the cities of Judah. &l16&rAnd I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. &l17&rThou
Book1Page8=inhabitants of the land. &l15&rFor, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof
Book1Page7=&l13&rAnd the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north. &l14&rThen the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the
Book1Page6=down, to build, and to plant. &l11&rMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. &l12&rThen said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen\: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
Book1Page5=LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. &l10&rSee, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw
Book13Page9=Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you\: &l19&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
Book1Page4=&l7&rBut the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child\: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. &l8&rBe not afraid of their faces\: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. &l9&rThen the
Book13Page8=upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them\: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered. &l18&rAnd Jeremiah said unto the house of the
Book1Page3=saying, &l5&rBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. &l6&rThen said I, Ah, Lord GOD\! behold, I cannot speak\: for I am a child.
Book13Page7=sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me\: &l17&rTherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and
Book1Page2=also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. &l4&rThen the word of the LORD came unto me,
Book13Page6=ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers\: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. &l16&rBecause the
Book1Page1=Chapter 1\nThe words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin\: &l2&rTo whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. &l3&rIt came
Book13Page5=drink none, but obey their father's commandment\: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. &l15&rI have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return
Book13Page4=the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. &l14&rThe words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they
Book13Page3=let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians\: so we dwell at Jerusalem. &l12&rThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, &l13&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell
Book8Page19=walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. &l18&rFor who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it? &l19&rBehold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone
Book13Page2=vineyard, nor field, nor seed\: &l10&rBut we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. &l11&rBut it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and
Book8Page18=the prophets that prophesy unto you\: they make you vain\: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD. &l17&rThey say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that
Book13Page1=Chapter 35 Cont.\nThus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; &l9&rNor to build houses for us to dwell in\: neither have we
Book8Page17=hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall\: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. &l16&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of
Book8Page16=thing\: they commit adultery, and walk in lies\: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness\: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. &l15&rTherefore thus saith the LORD of
Book8Page15=bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. &l13&rAnd I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. &l14&rI have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible
Book8Page14=not right. &l11&rFor both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD. &l12&rWherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness\: they shall be driven on, and fall therein\: for I will
Book8Page13=overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness. &l10&rFor the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is
Book8Page12=out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land. &l9&rMine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath
Book12Page49=cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. &l6&rBut they said, We will drink no wine\: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever\: &l7&rNeither shall ye build house, nor sow
Book8Page11=&l7&rTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; &l8&rBut, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel
Book12Page48=of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door\: &l5&rAnd I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and
Book8Page10=Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. &l6&rIn his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely\: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Book12Page47=and give them wine to drink. &l3&rThen I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; &l4&rAnd I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons
Book12Page46=Chapter 35\nThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, &l2&rGo unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers,
Book12Page45=saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire\: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
Book12Page44=earth. &l21&rAnd Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. &l22&rBehold, I will command,
Book12Page43=land, which passed between the parts of the calf; &l20&rI will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life\: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the
Book12Page42=performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, &l19&rThe princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the
Book12Page41=behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. &l18&rAnd I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not
Book12Page40=pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. &l17&rTherefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour\:
Book12Page39=liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name\: &l16&rBut ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their
Book12Page38=which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee\: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. &l15&rAnd ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming
Book12Page37=&l13&rThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, &l14&rAt the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew,
Book12Page36=&l11&rBut afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. &l12&rTherefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Book12Page35=all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
Book12Page34=were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; &l9&rThat every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. &l10&rNow when
Book12Page33=of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah\: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah. &l8&rThis is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which
Book12Page32=thee, saying, Ah lord\! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. &l6&rThen Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, &l7&rWhen the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities
Book12Page31=Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword\: &l5&rBut thou shalt die in peace\: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament
Book12Page30=escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. &l4&rYet hear the word of the LORD, O
Book12Page29=saying, &l2&rThus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire\: &l3&rAnd thou shalt not
Book12Page28=Chapter 34\n &l1&rThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof,
Book12Page27=earth; &l26&rThen will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
Book12Page26=hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. &l25&rThus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and
Book12Page25=measured\: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me. &l23&rMoreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, &l24&rConsiderest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD
Book12Page24=season; &l21&rThen may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. &l22&rAs the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea
Book12Page23=offerings, and to do sacrifice continually. &l19&rAnd the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, &l20&rThus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their
Book12Page22=be called, The LORD our righteousness. &l17&rFor thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; &l18&rNeither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat
Book12Page21=at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. &l16&rIn those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely\: and this is the name wherewith she shall
Book12Page20=flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD. &l14&rBehold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. &l15&rIn those days, and
Book12Page19=habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. &l13&rIn the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the
Book12Page18=house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD. &l12&rThus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an
Book12Page17=voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts\: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever\: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the
Book12Page16=heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, &l11&rThe voice of joy, and the
Book12Page15=and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them\: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it. &l10&rThus saith the LORD; Again there shall be
Book12Page14=&l8&rAnd I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. &l9&rAnd it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise
Book12Page13=&l6&rBehold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. &l7&rAnd I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
Book12Page12=down by the mounts, and by the sword; &l5&rThey come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
Book12Page11=&l3&rCall unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. &l4&rFor thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown
Book7Page50=in Bashan, and cry from the passages\: for all thy lovers are destroyed. &l21&rI spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
Book12Page10=Chapter 33\nMoreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, &l2&rThus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;
Book2Page9=I, Ah, Lord GOD\! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. &l11&rAt that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the
Book2Page8=of the LORD is not turned back from us. &l9&rAnd it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. &l10&rThen said
Book2Page7=his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant. &l8&rFor this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl\: for the fierce anger
Book2Page6=in the land\: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. &l6&rSet up the standard toward Zion\: retire, stay not\: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. &l7&rThe lion is come up from
Book2Page5=foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem\: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. &l5&rDeclare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet
Book2Page4=the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory. &l3&rFor thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. &l4&rCircumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the
Book2Page3=Chapter 4\nIf thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me\: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove. &l2&rAnd thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and
Book2Page2=herds, their sons and their daughters. &l25&rWe lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us\: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
Book7Page49=Ah my brother\! or, Ah sister\! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord\! or, Ah his glory\! &l19&rHe shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. &l20&rGo up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice
Book2Page1=Chapter 3 Cont.\nTruly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains\: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel. &l24&rFor shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their
Book7Page48=thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it. &l18&rTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying,
Book7Page47=thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? &l16&rHe judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him\: was not this to know me? saith the LORD. &l17&rBut thine eyes and
Book7Page46=service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; &l14&rThat saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. &l15&rShalt thou reign, because thou closest
Book7Page45=not return thither any more\: &l12&rBut he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more. &l13&rWoe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's
Book7Page44=sore for him that goeth away\: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country. &l11&rFor thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall
Book7Page43=Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city? &l9&rThen they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them. &l10&rWeep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him\: but weep
Book7Page42=inhabited. &l7&rAnd I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons\: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. &l8&rAnd many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour,
Book7Page41=swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation. &l6&rFor thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon\: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not
Book7Page40=place. &l4&rFor if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. &l5&rBut if ye will not hear these words, I
Book3Page50=they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. &l6&rThine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.
Book7Page39=these gates\: &l3&rThus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor\: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this
Book7Page38=Chapter 22\nThus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, &l2&rAnd say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by
Ch9=B4P14
Book7Page37=the LORD\: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.
Ch8=B3P46
Book7Page36=&l13&rBehold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? &l14&rBut I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith
Ch7=B3P30
Book7Page35=the LORD; &l12&rO house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Ch6=B3P9
Book7Page34=&l10&rFor I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD\: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. &l11&rAnd touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of
Ch5=B2P40
Book7Page33=the way of death. &l9&rHe that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence\: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
Ch4=B2P21
Book7Page32=hand of those that seek their life\: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. &l8&rAnd unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and
Ch3=B2P2
Book7Page31=deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the
Ch2=B1P34
Book7Page30=with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. &l6&rAnd I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast\: they shall die of a great pestilence. &l7&rAnd afterward, saith the LORD, I will
Ch1=B1P12
Book3Page49=LORD. &l4&rTake ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother\: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders. &l5&rAnd they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth\:
Book16Page50=rod\! &l18&rThou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.
Book3Page48=go from them\! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. &l3&rAnd they bend their tongues like their bow for lies\: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the
Book3Page47=Chapter 9\nOh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people\! &l2&rOh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and
Book3Page46=recovered?
Book3Page45=and we are not saved. &l21&rFor the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. &l22&rIs there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people
Book3Page44=the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country\: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? &l20&rThe harvest is past, the summer is ended,
Book3Page43=therein. &l17&rFor, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. &l18&rWhen I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. &l19&rBehold the voice of the cry of
Book3Page42=health, and behold trouble\! &l16&rThe snorting of his horses was heard from Dan\: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell
Book3Page41=let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there\: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. &l15&rWe looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of
Book3Page40=&l13&rI will surely consume them, saith the LORD\: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them. &l14&rWhy do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and
Book7Page29=back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. &l5&rAnd I myself will fight against you
Book7Page28=maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. &l3&rThen said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah\: &l4&rThus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn
Book7Page27=Chapter 21\nThe word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying, &l2&rInquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
Book16Page49=saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. &l16&rThe calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. &l17&rAll ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful
Book16Page48=ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. &l14&rHow say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? &l15&rMoab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter,
Book7Page26=womb to be always great with me. &l18&rWherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
Book7Page25=glad. &l16&rAnd let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not\: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide; &l17&rBecause he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her
Book16Page47=remained in him, and his scent is not changed. &l12&rTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. &l13&rAnd Moab shall be
Book16Page46=deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood. &l11&rMoab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity\: therefore his taste
Book7Page24=soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers. &l14&rCursed be the day wherein I was born\: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed. &l15&rCursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very
Book7Page23=never be forgotten. &l12&rBut, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them\: for unto thee have I opened my cause. &l13&rSing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD\: for he hath delivered the
Book16Page45=shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken. &l9&rGive wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away\: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. &l10&rCursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD
Book16Page44=thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken\: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together. &l8&rAnd the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape\: the valley also
Book7Page22=and we shall take our revenge on him. &l11&rBut the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one\: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail\: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper\: their everlasting confusion shall
Book7Page21=with forbearing, and I could not stay. &l10&rFor I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him,
Book16Page43=caused a cry to be heard. &l5&rFor in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. &l6&rFlee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. &l7&rFor because
Book16Page42=against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee. &l3&rA voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. &l4&rMoab is destroyed; her little ones have
Book7Page20=spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. &l9&rThen I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary
Book3Page39=is no peace. &l12&rWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush\: therefore shall they fall among them that fall\: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
Book16Page41=Chapter 48\nAgainst Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo\! for it is spoiled\: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken\: Misgab is confounded and dismayed. &l2&rThere shall be no more praise of Moab\: in Heshbon they have devised evil
Book3Page38=them\: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. &l11&rFor they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there
Book16Page40=into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. &l7&rHow can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
Book3Page37=of the scribes is in vain. &l9&rThe wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken\: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? &l10&rTherefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit
Book3Page36=appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD. &l8&rHow do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen
Book3Page35=refuse to return. &l6&rI hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright\: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle. &l7&rYea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her
Book3Page34=LORD of hosts. &l4&rMoreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return? &l5&rWhy then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they
Book11Page50=of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Book3Page33=gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. &l3&rAnd death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the
Book3Page32=graves\: &l2&rAnd they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped\: they shall not be
Book3Page31=Chapter 8\n &l1&rAt that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their
Book3Page30=mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride\: for the land shall be desolate.
Book7Page19=thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. &l7&rO LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived\: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed\: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. &l8&rFor since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and
Book7Page18=enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. &l6&rAnd thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity\: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all
Book16Page39=Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. &l5&rBaldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley\: how long wilt thou cut thyself? &l6&rO thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself
Book7Page17=into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. &l5&rMoreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their
Book7Page16=LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends\: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it\: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive
Book16Page38=of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands; &l4&rBecause of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth\: for the LORD will spoil the
Book16Page37=and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein\: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl. &l3&rAt the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling
Book7Page15=Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD. &l3&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib. &l4&rFor thus saith the
Book7Page14=Chapter 20\nNow Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. &l2&rThen Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of
Book16Page36=Chapter 47\nThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. &l2&rThus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land,
Book7Page13=all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.
Book16Page35=nations whither I have driven thee\: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
Book16Page34=afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid. &l28&rFear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD\: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the
Book11Page49=with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. &l31&rFor this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, &l32&rBecause of all the evil
Book7Page12=Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people, &l15&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns
Book11Page48=incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. &l30&rFor the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth\: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger
Book7Page11=Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. &l14&rThen came
Book16Page33=of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants\: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD. &l27&rBut fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel\: for, behold, I will save thee from
Book16Page32=Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him\: &l26&rAnd I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand
Book11Page47=hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it\: &l29&rAnd the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered
Book7Page10=vessel, that cannot be made whole again\: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury. &l12&rThus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet\: &l13&rAnd the houses of
Book3Page29=&l33&rAnd the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away. &l34&rThen will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of
Book11Page46=into the hand of the Chaldeans. &l26&rThen came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, &l27&rBehold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh\: is there any thing too hard for me? &l28&rTherefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the
Book16Page31=the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable. &l24&rThe daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. &l25&rThe LORD of hosts, the God of
Book16Page30=day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation. &l22&rThe voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. &l23&rThey shall cut down her forest, saith
Book3Page28=not, neither came it into my heart. &l32&rTherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter\: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
Book11Page45=because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence\: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it. &l25&rAnd thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given
Book3Page27=have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it. &l31&rAnd they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them
Book11Page44=done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do\: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them\: &l24&rBehold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it,
Book3Page26=mouth. &l29&rCut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. &l30&rFor the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD\: they
Book11Page43=with great terror; &l22&rAnd hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; &l23&rAnd they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have
Book3Page25=hearken to thee\: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee. &l28&rBut thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction\: truth is perished, and is cut off from their
Book11Page42=unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; &l21&rAnd hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and
Book3Page24=the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them\: &l26&rYet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck\: they did worse than their fathers. &l27&rTherefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not
Book11Page41=&l19&rGreat in counsel, and mighty in work\: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men\: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings\: &l20&rWhich hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even
Book3Page23=inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. &l25&rSince the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants
Book11Page40=arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee\: &l18&rThou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them\: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,
Book3Page22=offerings or sacrifices\: &l23&rBut this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people\: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. &l24&rBut they hearkened not, nor
Book3Page21=&l21&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. &l22&rFor I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt
Book3Page20=&l20&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
Book16Page29=&l20&rEgypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north. &l21&rAlso her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together\: they did not stand, because the
Book16Page28=name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come. &l19&rO thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity\: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
Book3Page9=melteth in vain\: for the wicked are not plucked away. &l30&rReprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.
Book3Page8=fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. &l28&rThey are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders\: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters. &l29&rThe bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder
Book16Page27=they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword. &l17&rThey did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed. &l18&rAs I live, saith the King, whose
Book16Page26=Noph and in Tahpanhes\: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee. &l15&rWhy are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them. &l16&rHe made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another\: and
Book3Page7=on every side. &l26&rO daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes\: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation\: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. &l27&rI have set thee for a tower and a
Book3Page6=against thee, O daughter of Zion. &l24&rWe have heard the fame thereof\: our hands wax feeble\: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail. &l25&rGo not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is
Book16Page25=against the mighty, and they are fallen both together. &l13&rThe word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. &l14&rDeclare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in
Book16Page24=&l11&rGo up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt\: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured. &l12&rThe nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land\: for the mighty man hath stumbled
Book11Page39=possessed again in this land. &l16&rNow when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, &l17&rAh Lord GOD\! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out
Book3Page5=from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. &l23&rThey shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war
Book11Page38=evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. &l15&rFor thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be
Book3Page4=unto me. &l21&rTherefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish. &l22&rThus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh
Book16Page23=&l10&rFor this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries\: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood\: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
Book16Page22=cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. &l9&rCome up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
Book11Page37=presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. &l13&rAnd I charged Baruch before them, saying, &l14&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this
Book3Page3=thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it. &l20&rTo what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet
Book3Page19=dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. &l19&rDo they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD\: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
Book11Page36=the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open\: &l12&rAnd I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the
Book3Page2=saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. &l18&rTherefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. &l19&rHear, O earth\: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their
Book16Page21=stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates. &l7&rWho is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers? &l8&rEgypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will
Book16Page20=&l5&rWherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back\: for fear was round about, saith the LORD. &l6&rLet not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall
Book3Page1=Chapter 6 Cont.\nThus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein. &l17&rAlso I set watchmen over you,
Book11Page35=Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. &l10&rAnd I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. &l11&rSo I took the evidence of
Book3Page18=prayer for them, neither make intercession to me\: for I will not hear thee. &l17&rSeest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? &l18&rThe children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their
Book11Page34=Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin\: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. &l9&rAnd I bought the field of
Book3Page17=place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. &l15&rAnd I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. &l16&rTherefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
Book11Page33=thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth\: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. &l8&rSo Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me,
Book3Page16=have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not; &l14&rTherefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the
Book11Page32=shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD\: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper? &l6&rAnd Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l7&rBehold, Hanameel the son of Shallum
Book3Page15=den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD. &l12&rBut go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. &l13&rAnd now, because ye
Book11Page31=shall take it; &l4&rAnd Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; &l5&rAnd he
Book3Page14=incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; &l10&rAnd come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? &l11&rIs this house, which is called by my name, become a
Book11Page30=court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house. &l3&rFor Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he
Book3Page13=your hurt\: &l7&rThen will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. &l8&rBehold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. &l9&rWill ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn
Book3Page12=throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; &l6&rIf ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to
Book3Page11=the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. &l4&rTrust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these. &l5&rFor if ye
Book3Page10=Chapter 7\nThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, &l2&rStand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD. &l3&rThus saith
Book16Page19=fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. &l3&rOrder ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. &l4&rHarness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.
Book16Page18=Chapter 46\nThe word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles; &l2&rAgainst Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the
Book16Page17=all places whither thou goest.
Book16Page16=break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. &l5&rAnd seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not\: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD\: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in
