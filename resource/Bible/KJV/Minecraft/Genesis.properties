Book16Page15=alive. &l31&rAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; &l32&rAnd the men are shepherds, for
Book11Page29=Chapter 34\nAnd Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. &l2&rAnd when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. &l3&rAnd his
Book16Page14=his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. &l30&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet
Book11Page28=parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. &l20&rAnd he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.
Book16Page13=Egypt, were two souls\: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. &l28&rAnd he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. &l29&rAnd Joseph made ready
Book11Page27=and made booths for his cattle\: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. &l18&rAnd Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. &l19&rAnd he bought a
Book16Page12=she bare these unto Jacob\: all the souls were seven. &l26&rAll the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; &l27&rAnd the sons of Joseph, which were born him in
Book11Page26=said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. &l16&rSo Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. &l17&rAnd Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house,
Book16Page11=Rachel, which were born to Jacob\: all the souls were fourteen. &l23&rAnd the sons of Dan; Hushim. &l24&rAnd the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. &l25&rThese are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and
Book11Page25=one day, all the flock will die. &l14&rLet my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant\: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. &l15&rAnd Esau
Book16Page10=born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. &l21&rAnd the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. &l22&rThese are the sons of
Book11Page24=he took it. &l12&rAnd he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. &l13&rAnd he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me\: and if men should overdrive them
Book11Page23=therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. &l11&rTake, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and
Book11Page22=These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. &l9&rAnd Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. &l10&rAnd Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand\: for
Book11Page21=children, and they bowed themselves. &l7&rAnd Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves\: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. &l8&rAnd he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said,
Book11Page20=kissed him\: and they wept. &l5&rAnd he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. &l6&rThen the handmaidens came near, they and their
Book11Page19=Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. &l3&rAnd he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. &l4&rAnd Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
Book11Page18=Chapter 33\nAnd Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. &l2&rAnd he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and
Book11Page17=he halted upon his thigh. &l32&rTherefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day\: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
Book11Page16=said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. &l30&rAnd Jacob called the name of the place Peniel\: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. &l31&rAnd as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and
Book11Page15=thy name? And he said, Jacob. &l28&rAnd he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel\: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. &l29&rAnd Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he
Book11Page14=touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. &l26&rAnd he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. &l27&rAnd he said unto him, What is
Book11Page13=ford Jabbok. &l23&rAnd he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. &l24&rAnd Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. &l25&rAnd when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he
Book11Page12=face; peradventure he will accept of me. &l21&rSo went the present over before him\: and himself lodged that night in the company. &l22&rAnd he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the
Book11Page11=followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. &l20&rAnd say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his
Book11Page10=whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? &l18&rThen thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau\: and, behold, also he is behind us. &l19&rAnd so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
Book14Page9=and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. &l28&rThis is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh\: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. &l29&rBehold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout
Book14Page8=Pharaoh is one\: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. &l26&rThe seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years\: the dream is one. &l27&rAnd the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years;
Book14Page7=withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them\: &l24&rAnd the thin ears devoured the seven good ears\: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. &l25&rAnd Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of
Book14Page6=eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. &l22&rAnd I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good\: &l23&rAnd, behold, seven ears,
Book14Page5=behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness\: &l20&rAnd the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine\: &l21&rAnd when they had
Book14Page4=give Pharaoh an answer of peace. &l17&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river\: &l18&rAnd, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow\: &l19&rAnd,
Book14Page3=&l15&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it\: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. &l16&rAnd Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me\: God shall
Book14Page2=interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. &l14&rThen Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon\: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
Book14Page1=Chapter 41 Cont.\nAnd there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, as he
Book2Page50=&l9&rBut the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth\: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
Book4Page9=Sarai Abram's wife. &l18&rAnd Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? &l19&rWhy saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife\: now therefore behold
Book4Page8=into Pharaoh's house. &l16&rAnd he entreated Abram well for her sake\: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. &l17&rAnd the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of
Book4Page7=my soul shall live because of thee. &l14&rAnd it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. &l15&rThe princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh\: and the woman was taken
Book4Page6=&l12&rTherefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife\: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. &l13&rSay, I pray thee, thou art my sister\: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and
Book2Page49=window of the ark which he had made\: &l7&rAnd he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. &l8&rAlso he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
Book4Page5=and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon\:
Book15Page50=&l28&rAnd Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive\: I will go and see him before I die.
Book2Page48=upon the mountains of Ararat. &l5&rAnd the waters decreased continually until the tenth month\: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. &l6&rAnd it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
Book4Page4=and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east\: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. &l9&rAnd Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. &l10&rAnd there was a famine in the land\:
Book2Page47=the rain from heaven was restrained; &l3&rAnd the waters returned from off the earth continually\: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. &l4&rAnd the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month,
Book4Page3=Canaanite was then in the land. &l7&rAnd the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land\: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. &l8&rAnd he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
Book2Page46=Chapter 8\nAnd God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark\: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; &l2&rThe fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and
Book4Page2=they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. &l6&rAnd Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the
Book2Page45=&l24&rAnd the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
Book4Page1=Chapter 12 Cont.\nSo Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him\: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. &l5&rAnd Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that
Book2Page44=&l23&rAnd every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth\: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
Book2Page43=all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man\: &l22&rAll in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
Book2Page42=upon the face of the waters. &l19&rAnd the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. &l20&rFifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. &l21&rAnd
Book2Page41=him\: and the LORD shut him in. &l17&rAnd the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. &l18&rAnd the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went
Book2Page40=kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. &l15&rAnd they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. &l16&rAnd they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded
Book15Page49=of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. &l27&rAnd they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them\: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived\:
Book15Page48=they departed\: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. &l25&rAnd they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, &l26&rAnd told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land
Book15Page47=silver, and five changes of raiment. &l23&rAnd to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. &l24&rSo he sent his brethren away, and
Book15Page46=&l21&rAnd the children of Israel did so\: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. &l22&rTo all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of
Book15Page45=land. &l19&rNow thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. &l20&rAlso regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
Book15Page44=unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; &l18&rAnd take your father and your households, and come unto me\: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the
Book15Page43=kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them\: and after that his brethren talked with him. &l16&rAnd the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come\: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. &l17&rAnd Pharaoh said
Book15Page42=&l13&rAnd ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. &l14&rAnd he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. &l15&rMoreover he
Book15Page41=will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. &l12&rAnd, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Book2Page39=Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; &l14&rThey, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
Book15Page40=lord of all Egypt\: come down unto me, tarry not\: &l10&rAnd thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast\: &l11&rAnd there
Book2Page38=seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. &l12&rAnd the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. &l13&rIn the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and
Book2Page37=and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. &l10&rAnd it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. &l11&rIn the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
Book2Page36=in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. &l8&rOf clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, &l9&rThere went in two
Book2Page35=every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. &l5&rAnd Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. &l6&rAnd Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. &l7&rAnd Noah went
Book2Page34=clean by two, the male and his female. &l3&rOf fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. &l4&rFor yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and
Book2Page33=Chapter 7\nAnd the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. &l2&rOf every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female\: and of beasts that are not
Book2Page32=shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. &l21&rAnd take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. &l22&rThus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
Book2Page31=all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. &l20&rOf fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort
Book2Page30=life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. &l18&rBut with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. &l19&rAnd of every living thing of
Book15Page39=was not you that sent me hither, but God\: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. &l9&rHaste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me
Book15Page38=hath the famine been in the land\: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. &l7&rAnd God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. &l8&rSo now it
Book15Page37=I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. &l5&rNow therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither\: for God did send me before you to preserve life. &l6&rFor these two years
Book15Page36=Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. &l3&rAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. &l4&rAnd Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me,
Book15Page35=Chapter 45\nThen Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. &l2&rAnd he wept aloud\: and the
Book15Page34=lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. &l34&rFor how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
Book15Page33=the grave. &l32&rFor thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. &l33&rNow therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my
Book15Page32=the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; &l31&rIt shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die\: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to
Book15Page31=me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since\: &l29&rAnd if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. &l30&rNow therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and
Book2Page29=finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. &l17&rAnd, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of
Book15Page30=down\: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down\: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. &l27&rAnd thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons\: &l28&rAnd the one went out from
Book2Page28=pitch. &l15&rAnd this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of\: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. &l16&rA window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
Book2Page27=end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. &l14&rMake thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with
Book2Page26=Ham, and Japheth. &l11&rThe earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. &l12&rAnd God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. &l13&rAnd God said unto Noah, The
Book2Page25=air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. &l8&rBut Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. &l9&rThese are the generations of Noah\: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. &l10&rAnd Noah begat three sons, Shem,
Book2Page24=&l6&rAnd it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. &l7&rAnd the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the
Book2Page23=men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. &l5&rAnd GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
Book2Page22=LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh\: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. &l4&rThere were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of
Book2Page21=Chapter 6\nAnd it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, &l2&rThat the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. &l3&rAnd the
Book2Page20=seven hundred seventy and seven years\: and he died. &l32&rAnd Noah was five hundred years old\: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Book15Page29=brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. &l24&rAnd it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. &l25&rAnd our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. &l26&rAnd we said, We cannot go
Book15Page28=servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. &l22&rAnd we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father\: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. &l23&rAnd thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
Book15Page27=Have ye a father, or a brother? &l20&rAnd we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. &l21&rAnd thou saidst unto thy
Book15Page26=your father. &l18&rThen Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant\: for thou art even as Pharaoh. &l19&rMy lord asked his servants, saying,
Book15Page25=servants\: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. &l17&rAnd he said, God forbid that I should do so\: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto
Book15Page24=said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? &l16&rAnd Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
Book15Page23=was found in Benjamin's sack. &l13&rThen they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. &l14&rAnd Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there\: and they fell before him on the ground. &l15&rAnd Joseph
Book15Page22=with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. &l11&rThen they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. &l12&rAnd he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest\: and the cup
Book15Page21=land of Canaan\: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? &l9&rWith whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. &l10&rAnd he said, Now also let it be according unto your words\: he

Book6Page47=fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. &l13&rAnd Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns\: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt
Book6Page46=the knife to slay his son. &l11&rAnd the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham\: and he said, Here am I. &l12&rAnd he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him\: for now I know that thou

Book6Page44=father, and said, My father\: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood\: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? &l8&rAnd Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering\: so they went both of
Book6Page43=yonder and worship, and come again to you. &l6&rAnd Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. &l7&rAnd Isaac spake unto Abraham his
Book6Page42=offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. &l4&rThen on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. &l5&rAnd Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go
Book6Page41=offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. &l3&rAnd Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt

Book6Page39=of the LORD, the everlasting God. &l34&rAnd Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
Book6Page38=both of them. &l32&rThus they made a covenant at Beersheba\: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. &l33&rAnd Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name
Book6Page37=lambs which thou hast set by themselves? &l30&rAnd he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. &l31&rWherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware
Book6Page36=of it, but to day. &l27&rAnd Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. &l28&rAnd Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. &l29&rAnd Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe

Book6Page34=therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son\: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. &l24&rAnd

Book6Page32=&l19&rAnd God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. &l20&rAnd God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. &l21&rAnd he dwelt in the

Book6Page30=&l16&rAnd she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot\: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. &l17&rAnd God heard the voice of the lad; and

Book6Page22=and his maidservants; and they bare children. &l18&rFor the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
Book6Page21=Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver\: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other\: thus she was reproved. &l17&rSo Abraham prayed unto God\: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife,

Book6Page9=make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. &l35&rAnd they made their father drink wine that night also\: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down,
Book6Page8=that night\: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. &l34&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father\: let us
Book6Page7=old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth\: &l32&rCome, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. &l33&rAnd they made their father drink wine

Book6Page3=Zoar. &l24&rThen the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; &l25&rAnd he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. &l26&rBut his

Book6Page18=thou hast done this thing? &l11&rAnd Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. &l12&rAnd yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my

Book10Page43=affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. &l43&rAnd Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine\: and
Book10Page42=thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle\: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. &l42&rExcept the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine
Book10Page41=require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. &l40&rThus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. &l41&rThus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for
Book10Page40=&l38&rThis twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. &l39&rThat which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou
Book10Page39=trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? &l37&rWhereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
Book10Page38=her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. &l36&rAnd Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban\: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my
Book10Page37=he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. &l34&rNow Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. &l35&rAnd she said to
Book10Page36=thy gods, let him not live\: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. &l33&rAnd Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but
Book10Page35=sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? &l31&rAnd Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid\: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. &l32&rWith whomsoever thou findest
Book10Page34=in so doing. &l29&rIt is in the power of my hand to do you hurt\: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. &l30&rAnd now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou
Book10Page33=thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? &l28&rAnd hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly
Book10Page32=the mount\: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. &l26&rAnd Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? &l27&rWherefore didst
Book10Page31=journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. &l24&rAnd God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. &l25&rThen Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
Book10Page30=fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. &l22&rAnd it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. &l23&rAnd he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'
Book10Page29=to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. &l19&rAnd Laban went to shear his sheep\: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. &l20&rAnd Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. &l21&rSo he
Book10Page28=whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. &l17&rThen Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; &l18&rAnd he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for
Book10Page27=inheritance for us in our father's house? &l15&rAre we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. &l16&rFor all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's\: now then,
Book10Page26=of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me\: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. &l14&rAnd Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or
Book10Page25=unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob\: And I said, Here am I. &l12&rAnd he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled\: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. &l13&rI am the God
Book10Page24=given them to me. &l10&rAnd it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. &l11&rAnd the angel of God spake
Book10Page23=to hurt me. &l8&rIf he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled\: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. &l9&rThus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and
Book10Page22=countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. &l6&rAnd ye know that with all my power I have served your father. &l7&rAnd your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not
Book10Page21=as before. &l3&rAnd the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. &l4&rAnd Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, &l5&rAnd said unto them, I see your father's
Book10Page20=Chapter 31\nAnd he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. &l2&rAnd Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him
Book17Page9=the blood of grapes\: &l12&rHis eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. &l13&rZebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. &l14&rIssachar is a strong ass couching
Book17Page8=depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. &l11&rBinding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in
Book17Page7=neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. &l9&rJudah is a lion's whelp\: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up\: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? &l10&rThe sceptre shall not
Book17Page6=selfwill they digged down a wall. &l7&rCursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel\: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. &l8&rJudah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise\: thy hand shall be in the
Book17Page5=went up to my couch. &l5&rSimeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. &l6&rO my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united\: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their
Book17Page4=&l3&rReuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power\: &l4&rUnstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it\: he
Book17Page3=Chapter 49\nAnd Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. &l2&rGather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
Book17Page2=you again unto the land of your fathers. &l22&rMoreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Book17Page1=Chapter 48 Cont.\nAnd he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh\: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. &l21&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die\: but God shall be with you, and bring
Book10Page19=menservants, and camels, and asses.
Book10Page18=gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. &l42&rBut when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in\: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. &l43&rAnd the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and
Book10Page17=all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. &l41&rAnd it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the
Book10Page16=they should conceive when they came to drink. &l39&rAnd the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. &l40&rAnd Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and
Book10Page15=and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. &l38&rAnd he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that
Book10Page14=that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. &l36&rAnd he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob\: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. &l37&rAnd Jacob took him rods of green poplar,
Book10Page13=that shall be counted stolen with me. &l34&rAnd Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. &l35&rAnd he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one
Book10Page12=speckled among the goats\: and of such shall be my hire. &l33&rSo shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face\: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep,
Book10Page11=me any thing\: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock\: &l32&rI will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and
Book10Page10=which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming\: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? &l31&rAnd he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give
Book7Page9=answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, &l11&rNay, my lord, hear me\: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people
Book7Page8=me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. &l10&rAnd Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth\: and Ephron the Hittite
Book7Page7=and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. &l8&rAnd he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, &l9&rThat he may give
Book7Page6=answered Abraham, saying unto him, &l6&rHear us, my lord\: thou art a mighty prince among us\: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. &l7&rAnd Abraham stood up,
Book7Page5=&l3&rAnd Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, &l4&rI am a stranger and a sojourner with you\: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. &l5&rAnd the children of Heth

Book7Page1=Chapter 22 Cont.\nSo Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. &l20&rAnd it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born
Book1Page50=hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; &l12&rWhen thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
Book1Page49=LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not\: Am I my brother's keeper? &l10&rAnd he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. &l11&rAnd now art thou cursed from the earth, which
Book14Page50=your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words\: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Book1Page48=sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. &l8&rAnd Cain talked with Abel his brother\: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. &l9&rAnd the
Book1Page47=his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. &l6&rAnd the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? &l7&rIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well,
Book1Page46=it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. &l4&rAnd Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering\: &l5&rBut unto Cain and to
Book1Page45=Chapter 4\nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. &l2&rAnd she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. &l3&rAnd in process of time
Book1Page44=sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. &l24&rSo he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Book1Page43=coats of skins, and clothed them. &l22&rAnd the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil\: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever\: &l23&rTherefore the LORD God
Book1Page42=thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken\: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. &l20&rAnd Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. &l21&rUnto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make
Book1Page41=cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; &l18&rThorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; &l19&rIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till
Book1Page40=children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. &l17&rAnd unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it\:
Book14Page49=Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. &l6&rAnd Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? &l7&rAnd they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is
Book14Page48=solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. &l4&rIf thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food\: &l5&rBut if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down\: for the man said unto us,
Book14Page47=Chapter 43\nAnd the famine was sore in the land. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. &l3&rAnd Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did
Book14Page46=the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Book14Page45=saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee\: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. &l38&rAnd he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone\: if mischief befall him by the way in
Book14Page44=bundles of money, they were afraid. &l36&rAnd Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children\: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away\: all these things are against me. &l37&rAnd Reuben spake unto his father,
Book14Page43=but that ye are true men\: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. &l35&rAnd it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack\: and when both they and their father saw the
Book14Page42=country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone\: &l34&rAnd bring your youngest brother unto me\: then shall I know that ye are no spies,
Book14Page41=us for spies of the country. &l31&rAnd we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies\: &l32&rWe be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. &l33&rAnd the man, the lord of the
Book1Page39=will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. &l16&rUnto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
Book14Page40=saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? &l29&rAnd they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, &l30&rThe man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took
Book1Page38=me, and I did eat. &l14&rAnd the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life\: &l15&rAnd I
Book1Page37=that thou shouldest not eat? &l12&rAnd the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. &l13&rAnd the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled
Book1Page36=and said unto him, Where art thou? &l10&rAnd he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. &l11&rAnd he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee
Book1Page35=themselves aprons. &l8&rAnd they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day\: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. &l9&rAnd the LORD God called unto Adam,
Book1Page34=desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. &l7&rAnd the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
Book1Page33=&l5&rFor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. &l6&rAnd when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
Book1Page32=fruit of the trees of the garden\: &l3&rBut of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. &l4&rAnd the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die\:
Book1Page31=Chapter 3\nNow the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? &l2&rAnd the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the
Book1Page30=&l24&rTherefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife\: and they shall be one flesh. &l25&rAnd they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

Book14Page38=commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way\: and thus did he unto them. &l26&rAnd they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. &l27&rAnd as one of them opened
Book14Page37=Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. &l24&rAnd he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. &l25&rThen Joseph
Book14Page36=would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. &l22&rAnd Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. &l23&rAnd they knew not that
Book14Page35=your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. &l21&rAnd they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we
Book14Page34=into ward three days. &l18&rAnd Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God\: &l19&rIf ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison\: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses\: &l20&rBut bring
Book14Page33=come hither. &l16&rSend one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you\: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. &l17&rAnd he put them all together
Book14Page32=youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. &l14&rAnd Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies\: &l15&rHereby ye shall be proved\: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother
Book14Page31=man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. &l12&rAnd he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. &l13&rAnd they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the
Book1Page29=thereof; &l22&rAnd the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. &l23&rAnd Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh\: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
Book14Page30=not him. &l9&rAnd Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. &l10&rAnd they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. &l11&rWe are all one
Book1Page28=and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. &l21&rAnd the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept\: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
Book1Page27=ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them\: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. &l20&rAnd Adam gave names to all cattle,
Book1Page26=the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it\: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. &l18&rAnd the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. &l19&rAnd out of the
Book1Page25=fourth river is Euphrates. &l15&rAnd the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. &l16&rAnd the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat\: &l17&rBut of the tree of
Book1Page24=there is bdellium and the onyx stone. &l13&rAnd the name of the second river is Gihon\: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. &l14&rAnd the name of the third river is Hiddekel\: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the
Book1Page23=went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. &l11&rThe name of the first is Pison\: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; &l12&rAnd the gold of that land is good\:
Book1Page22=the man whom he had formed. &l9&rAnd out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &l10&rAnd a river
Book1Page21=and watered the whole face of the ground. &l7&rAnd the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. &l8&rAnd the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
Book1Page20=&l5&rAnd every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew\: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. &l6&rBut there went up a mist from the earth,
Book8Page9=Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham\: &l13&rAnd these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations\: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and
Book8Page8=which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth\: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. &l11&rAnd it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. &l12&rNow these are the generations of

Book14Page29=&l7&rAnd Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. &l8&rAnd Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew
Book8Page6=gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. &l7&rAnd these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. &l8&rThen Abraham gave up the ghost, and
Book14Page28=that came\: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. &l6&rAnd Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land\: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
Book8Page5=Leummim. &l4&rAnd the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. &l5&rAnd Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. &l6&rBut unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave
Book14Page27=and not die. &l3&rAnd Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. &l4&rBut Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. &l5&rAnd the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those
Book8Page4=Chapter 25\nThen again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. &l2&rAnd she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. &l3&rAnd Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and
Book14Page26=Chapter 42\nNow when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? &l2&rAnd he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt\: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live,
Book8Page3=herself. &l66&rAnd the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. &l67&rAnd Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her\: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Book14Page25=for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
Book8Page2=Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. &l65&rFor she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master\: therefore she took a vail, and covered
Book14Page24=Joseph; what he saith to you, do. &l56&rAnd the famine was over all the face of the earth\: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. &l57&rAnd all countries came into Egypt to Joseph
Book8Page1=Chapter 24 Cont.\nAnd Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. &l63&rAnd Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide\: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. &l64&rAnd
Book14Page23=to come, according as Joseph had said\: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. &l55&rAnd when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread\: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
Book14Page22=house. &l52&rAnd the name of the second called he Ephraim\: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. &l53&rAnd the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. &l54&rAnd the seven years of dearth began
Book14Page21=were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. &l51&rAnd Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh\: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
Book1Page19=and sanctified it\: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. &l4&rThese are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
Book14Page20=and laid up the food in the cities\: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. &l49&rAnd Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. &l50&rAnd unto Joseph
Book1Page18=Chapter 2\nThus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. &l2&rAnd on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. &l3&rAnd God blessed the seventh day,
Book1Page17=there is life, I have given every green herb for meat\: and it was so. &l31&rAnd God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Book1Page16=is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. &l30&rAnd to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
Book1Page15=multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it\: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. &l29&rAnd God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
Book1Page14=the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. &l27&rSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. &l28&rAnd God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
Book1Page13=creepeth upon the earth after his kind\: and God saw that it was good. &l26&rAnd God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all
Book1Page12=Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind\: and it was so. &l25&rAnd God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that
Book1Page11=after his kind\: and God saw that it was good. &l22&rAnd God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. &l23&rAnd the evening and the morning were the fifth day. &l24&rAnd God said,
Book1Page10=creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. &l21&rAnd God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl
Book14Page19=Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. &l47&rAnd in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. &l48&rAnd he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt,
Book14Page18=Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. &l46&rAnd Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And
Book14Page17=chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee\: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. &l44&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. &l45&rAnd
Book14Page16=I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. &l42&rAnd Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; &l43&rAnd he made him to ride in the second
Book14Page15=hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art\: &l40&rThou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled\: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. &l41&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See,
Book14Page14=&l37&rAnd the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. &l38&rAnd Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? &l39&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God
Book14Page13=come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. &l36&rAnd that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
Book14Page12=wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. &l34&rLet Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. &l35&rAnd let them gather all the food of those good years that
Book14Page11=famine following; for it shall be very grievous. &l32&rAnd for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. &l33&rNow therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and
Book9Page50=said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed\: and she called his name Naphtali. &l9&rWhen Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
Book14Page10=all the land of Egypt\: &l30&rAnd there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; &l31&rAnd the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that

Book9Page48=the fruit of the womb? &l3&rAnd she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. &l4&rAnd she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife\: and Jacob went in unto her. &l5&rAnd Bilhah
Book9Page47=Chapter 30\nAnd when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. &l2&rAnd Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel\: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee
Book9Page46=&l35&rAnd she conceived again, and bare a son\: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD\: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
Book9Page45=hath therefore given me this son also\: and she called his name Simeon. &l34&rAnd she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons\: therefore was his name called Levi.
Book9Page44=and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben\: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. &l33&rAnd she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he
Book9Page43=to be her maid. &l30&rAnd he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. &l31&rAnd when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb\: but Rachel was barren. &l32&rAnd Leah conceived,
Book9Page42=will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. &l28&rAnd Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week\: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. &l29&rAnd Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid
Book9Page41=to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? &l26&rAnd Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. &l27&rFulfil her week, and we
Book9Page40=in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. &l24&rAnd Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. &l25&rAnd it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah\: and he said
Ch50=B17P34
Book5Page50=thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die\:
Book9Page39=him but a few days, for the love he had to her. &l21&rAnd Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. &l22&rAnd Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. &l23&rAnd it came to pass
Book9Page38=said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. &l19&rAnd Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man\: abide with me. &l20&rAnd Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
Book9Page37=nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? &l16&rAnd Laban had two daughters\: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. &l17&rLeah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. &l18&rAnd Jacob loved Rachel; and
Ch49=B17P19
Book9Page36=house. And he told Laban all these things. &l14&rAnd Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. &l15&rAnd Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for
Ch48=B17P2
Book9Page35=her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son\: and she ran and told her father. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his
Ch47=B16P38
Book9Page34=of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. &l11&rAnd Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. &l12&rAnd Jacob told Rachel that he was
Ch46=B16P17
Book9Page33=stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. &l9&rAnd while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep\: for she kept them. &l10&rAnd it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep
Ch45=B15P50
Book9Page32=the sheep. &l7&rAnd he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together\: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. &l8&rAnd they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the
Ch44=B15P34
Book9Page31=brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. &l5&rAnd he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. &l6&rAnd he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well\: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with
Ch43=B15P16
Book9Page30=great stone was upon the well's mouth. &l3&rAnd thither were all the flocks gathered\: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. &l4&rAnd Jacob said unto them, My
Book5Page49=that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. &l18&rAnd Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord\: &l19&rBehold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
Ch42=B14P46
Book5Page48=laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him\: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
Ch41=B14P25
Book5Page47=that mocked unto his sons in law. &l15&rAnd when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. &l16&rAnd while he lingered, the men
Ch40=B13P44
Book5Page46=before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. &l14&rAnd Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one
Book5Page45=&l12&rAnd the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place\: &l13&rFor we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great
Book5Page44=&l10&rBut the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. &l11&rAnd they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great\: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
Book5Page43=&l9&rAnd they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge\: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
Book5Page42=wickedly. &l8&rBehold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes\: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
Book5Page41=called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. &l6&rAnd Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, &l7&rAnd said, I pray you, brethren, do not so
Book5Page40=his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. &l4&rBut before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter\: &l5&rAnd they
Book9Page29=Chapter 29\nThen Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. &l2&rAnd he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks\: and a
Book9Page28=shall the LORD be my God\: &l22&rAnd this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house\: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
Book9Page27=that city was called Luz at the first. &l20&rAnd Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, &l21&rSo that I come again to my father's house in peace; then
Ch39=B13P31
Book9Page26=this is the gate of heaven. &l18&rAnd Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. &l19&rAnd he called the name of that place Bethel\: but the name of
Ch38=B13P17
Book9Page25=done that which I have spoken to thee of. &l16&rAnd Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. &l17&rAnd he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place\! this is none other but the house of God, and
Ch37=B12P49
Book9Page24=south\: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. &l15&rAnd, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have
Ch36=B12P29
Book9Page23=of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac\: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; &l14&rAnd thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the
Ch35=B12P10
Book9Page22=in that place to sleep. &l12&rAnd he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven\: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. &l13&rAnd, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God
Ch34=B11P45
Book9Page9=and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him\: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? &l38&rAnd Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father.
Book9Page21=his wife. &l10&rAnd Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. &l11&rAnd he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down
Ch33=B11P28
Book9Page8=for he hath supplanted me these two times\: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? &l37&rAnd Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord,
Book9Page20=and was gone to Padanaram; &l8&rAnd Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; &l9&rThen went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be
Book5Page39=servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. &l3&rAnd he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into
Ch32=B11P17
Book9Page7=father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. &l35&rAnd he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. &l36&rAnd he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob?
Book5Page38=Chapter 19\nAnd there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom\: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; &l2&rAnd he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your

Ch30=B10P19
Book9Page5=meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. &l32&rAnd Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
Book5Page36=&l32&rAnd he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once\: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. &l33&rAnd the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham\:
Book9Page4=that blesseth thee. &l30&rAnd it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. &l31&rAnd he also had made savoury
Book5Page35=found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. &l31&rAnd he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord\: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
Book9Page3=of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine\: &l29&rLet people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee\: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee\: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he

Book9Page2=now, and kiss me, my son. &l27&rAnd he came near, and kissed him\: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed\: &l28&rTherefore God give thee of the dew
Book13Page50=and the chief baker\: &l11&rAnd we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
Book5Page33=have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes\: &l28&rPeradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous\: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
Book9Page1=Chapter 27 Cont.\nAnd he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat\: and he brought him wine, and he drank. &l26&rAnd his father Isaac said unto him, Come near
Book5Page32=wicked, that be far from thee\: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? &l26&rAnd the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. &l27&rAnd Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I
Book5Page31=be fifty righteous within the city\: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? &l25&rThat be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked\: and that the righteous should be as the
Book5Page30=and if not, I will know. &l22&rAnd the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom\: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. &l23&rAnd Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? &l24&rPeradventure there
Book9Page19=Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; &l7&rAnd that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother,

Book11Page7=with the children. &l12&rAnd thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. &l13&rAnd he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau

Book8Page17=Esau, because he did eat of his venison\: but Rebekah loved Jacob. &l29&rAnd Jacob sod pottage\: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint\: &l30&rAnd Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint\: therefore was his

Book8Page15=younger. &l24&rAnd when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. &l25&rAnd the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. &l26&rAnd after that came his brother out, and his hand
Book8Page14=And she went to inquire of the LORD. &l23&rAnd the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the

Book8Page12=died in the presence of all his brethren. &l19&rAnd these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son\: Abraham begat Isaac\: &l20&rAnd Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to

Book8Page11=these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years\: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. &l18&rAnd they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria\: and he

Book12Page46=unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. &l30&rAnd he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? &l31&rAnd they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the
Book12Page45=his brethren were content. &l28&rThen there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver\: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. &l29&rAnd Reuben returned
Book12Page44=carry it down to Egypt. &l26&rAnd Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? &l27&rCome, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And
Book12Page43=pit\: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. &l25&rAnd they sat down to eat bread\: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to
Book12Page42=him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; &l24&rAnd they took him, and cast him into a
Book12Page41=his dreams. &l21&rAnd Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. &l22&rAnd Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
Book12Page40=against him to slay him. &l19&rAnd they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. &l20&rCome now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him\: and we shall see what will become of
Book12Page39=their flocks. &l17&rAnd the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. &l18&rAnd when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired
Book12Page38=out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. &l15&rAnd a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field\: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? &l16&rAnd he said, I seek my brethren\: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed
Book12Page37=brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. &l14&rAnd he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him
Book12Page36=thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? &l11&rAnd his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. &l12&rAnd his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. &l13&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy
Book12Page35=more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. &l10&rAnd he told it to his father, and to his brethren\: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and
Book12Page34=him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. &l9&rAnd he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream
Book12Page33=pray you, this dream which I have dreamed\: &l7&rFor, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. &l8&rAnd his brethren said to
Book12Page32=brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. &l5&rAnd Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren\: and they hated him yet the more. &l6&rAnd he said unto them, Hear, I

Book7Page24=may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also\: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. &l15&rAnd it came to pass, before he had
Book16Page46=both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. &l14&rAnd Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and
Book16Page45=them. &l11&rAnd Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face\: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. &l12&rAnd Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. &l13&rAnd Joseph took them
Book7Page23=kindness unto my master Abraham. &l13&rBehold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water\: &l14&rAnd let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I
Book7Page22=&l11&rAnd he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. &l12&rAnd he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew
Book16Page44=sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. &l10&rNow the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
Book16Page43=in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath\: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. &l8&rAnd Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? &l9&rAnd Joseph said unto his father, They are my
Book7Page21=Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. &l10&rAnd the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand\: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
Book7Page20=thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. &l8&rAnd if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath\: only bring not my son thither again. &l9&rAnd the servant put his hand under the thigh of
Book16Page42=Simeon, they shall be mine. &l6&rAnd thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. &l7&rAnd as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan
Book16Page41=multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. &l5&rAnd now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and
Book3Page39=they left off to build the city. &l9&rTherefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth\: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. &l10&rThese are the
Book3Page38=restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. &l7&rGo to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. &l8&rSo the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth\: and
Book16Page40=strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. &l3&rAnd Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, &l4&rAnd said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a
Book3Page37=face of the whole earth. &l5&rAnd the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. &l6&rAnd the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do\: and now nothing will be
Book3Page36=brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. &l4&rAnd they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the
Book3Page35=Chapter 11\nAnd the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. &l3&rAnd they said one to another, Go to, let us make
Book3Page34=nations. &l32&rThese are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations\: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
Book3Page33=and Havilah, and Jobab\: all these were the sons of Joktan. &l30&rAnd their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. &l31&rThese are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their
Book11Page50=Elbethel\: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. &l8&rBut Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak\: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.
Book3Page32=was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. &l26&rAnd Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, &l27&rAnd Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, &l28&rAnd Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, &l29&rAnd Ophir,
Book3Page31=&l22&rThe children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. &l23&rAnd the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. &l24&rAnd Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. &l25&rAnd unto Eber were born two sons\: the name of one
Book3Page30=&l20&rThese are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. &l21&rUnto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
Book7Page19=bring not my son thither again. &l7&rThe LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before
Book7Page18=unto my son Isaac. &l5&rAnd the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land\: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? &l6&rAnd Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou
Book16Page39=Chapter 48\nAnd it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick\: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. &l2&rAnd one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee\: and Israel
Book7Page17=will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell\: &l4&rBut thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife
Book16Page38=said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
Book7Page16=Chapter 24\nAnd Abraham was old, and well stricken in age\: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. &l2&rAnd Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh\: &l3&rAnd I
Book7Page15=sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
Book16Page37=under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt\: &l30&rBut I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. &l31&rAnd he
Book16Page36=Egypt seventeen years\: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. &l29&rAnd the time drew nigh that Israel must die\: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand
Book7Page14=before all that went in at the gate of his city. &l19&rAnd after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre\: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. &l20&rAnd the field, and the cave that is therein, were made
Book7Page13=Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure &l18&rUnto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth,
Book16Page35=fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. &l27&rAnd Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. &l28&rAnd Jacob lived in the land of
Book16Page34=for food for your little ones. &l25&rAnd they said, Thou hast saved our lives\: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. &l26&rAnd Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the
Book7Page12=&l16&rAnd Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. &l17&rAnd the field of Ephron, which was in
Book11Page49=that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. &l6&rSo Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. &l7&rAnd he built there an altar, and called the place
Book7Page11=the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. &l14&rAnd Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, &l15&rMy lord, hearken unto me\: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
Book11Page48=went. &l4&rAnd they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. &l5&rAnd they journeyed\: and the terror of God was upon the cities
Book16Page33=is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. &l24&rAnd it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and
Book16Page32=for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them\: wherefore they sold not their lands. &l23&rThen Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh\: lo, here
Book7Page10=give I it thee\: bury thy dead. &l12&rAnd Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. &l13&rAnd he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me\: I will give thee money for
Book11Page47=him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments\: &l3&rAnd let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I
Book11Page46=Chapter 35\nAnd God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there\: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. &l2&rThen Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
Book3Page29=Hamathite\: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. &l19&rAnd the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
Book16Page31=his field, because the famine prevailed over them\: so the land became Pharaoh's. &l21&rAnd as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. &l22&rOnly the land of the priests bought he not;
Book16Page30=buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh\: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. &l20&rAnd Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man
Book11Page45=being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. &l31&rAnd they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
Book3Page28=whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. &l15&rAnd Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, &l16&rAnd the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, &l17&rAnd the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, &l18&rAnd the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the
Book11Page44=little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. &l30&rAnd Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites\: and I
Book3Page27=went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, &l12&rAnd Resen between Nineveh and Calah\: the same is a great city. &l13&rAnd Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, &l14&rAnd Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of
Book11Page43=came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. &l28&rThey took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, &l29&rAnd all their wealth, and all their
Book3Page26=earth. &l9&rHe was a mighty hunter before the LORD\: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. &l10&rAnd the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. &l11&rOut of that land
Book11Page42=Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. &l26&rAnd they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. &l27&rThe sons of Jacob
Book3Page25=&l6&rAnd the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. &l7&rAnd the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha\: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. &l8&rAnd Cush begat Nimrod\: he began to be a mighty one in the
Book11Page41=unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. &l25&rAnd it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and
Book3Page24=Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. &l4&rAnd the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. &l5&rBy these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
Book11Page40=us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. &l23&rShall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. &l24&rAnd unto Hamor and
Book3Page23=Chapter 10\nNow these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth\: and unto them were sons born after the flood. &l2&rThe sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. &l3&rAnd the sons of
Book3Page22=dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. &l28&rAnd Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. &l29&rAnd all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years\: and he died.
Book3Page21=younger son had done unto him. &l25&rAnd he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. &l26&rAnd he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. &l27&rGod shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall
Book3Page20=and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. &l24&rAnd Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his
Book16Page29=him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands\: &l19&rWherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?
Book16Page28=gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses\: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year. &l18&rWhen that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto
Book3Page9=Chapter 9\nAnd God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. &l2&rAnd the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
Book3Page8=remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
Book16Page27=unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread\: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. &l16&rAnd Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. &l17&rAnd they brought their cattle unto Joseph\: and Joseph
Book16Page26=the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought\: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. &l15&rAnd when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came
Book3Page7=savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. &l22&rWhile the earth
Book3Page6=creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. &l20&rAnd Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. &l21&rAnd the LORD smelled a sweet
Book16Page25=father's household, with bread, according to their families. &l13&rAnd there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. &l14&rAnd Joseph gathered up all
Book16Page24=Pharaoh. &l11&rAnd Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. &l12&rAnd Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
Book3Page5=earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. &l18&rAnd Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him\: &l19&rEvery beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
Book11Page39=therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. &l22&rOnly herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with

Book16Page23=hundred and thirty years\: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. &l10&rAnd Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before
Book16Page22=rulers over my cattle. &l7&rAnd Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh\: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. &l8&rAnd Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? &l9&rAnd Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an

Book11Page37=become one people. &l17&rBut if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. &l18&rAnd their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. &l19&rAnd the young man deferred not to do the thing, because

Book16Page21=father and thy brethren are come unto thee\: &l6&rThe land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell\: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them
Book16Page20=sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan\: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. &l5&rAnd Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy
Book3Page18=flesh that is upon the earth. &l18&rAnd the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth\: and Ham is the father of Canaan. &l19&rThese are the three sons of Noah\: and of them was the whole earth overspread. &l20&rAnd Noah began
Book11Page35=&l13&rAnd the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister\: &l14&rAnd they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a

Book3Page17=and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. &l17&rAnd God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all

Book3Page16=that the bow shall be seen in the cloud\: &l15&rAnd I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. &l16&rAnd the bow shall be in the cloud;

Book3Page15=me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations\: &l13&rI do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. &l14&rAnd it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,

Book3Page14=&l11&rAnd I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. &l12&rAnd God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between

Book3Page12=man shall his blood be shed\: for in the image of God made he man. &l7&rAnd you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. &l8&rAnd God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, &l9&rAnd I, behold, I
