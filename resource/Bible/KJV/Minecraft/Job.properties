Book2Page50=seen me\! &l19&rI should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. &l20&rAre not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
Book3Page29=Chapter 14\nMan that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. &l2&rHe cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down\: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. &l3&rAnd dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into
Book3Page28=of my youth. &l27&rThou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. &l28&rAnd he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
Book3Page27=and my sin. &l24&rWherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? &l25&rWilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? &l26&rFor thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities
Book3Page26=hide myself from thee. &l21&rWithdraw thine hand far from me\: and let not thy dread make me afraid. &l22&rThen call thou, and I will answer\: or let me speak, and answer thou me. &l23&rHow many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression
Book3Page25=declaration with your ears. &l18&rBehold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified. &l19&rWho is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. &l20&rOnly do not two things unto me\: then will I not
Book6Page49=rather than God. &l3&rAlso against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. &l4&rNow Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. &l5&rWhen Elihu saw that there was no
Book3Page24=my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? &l15&rThough he slay me, yet will I trust in him\: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. &l16&rHe also shall be my salvation\: for an hypocrite shall not come before him. &l17&rHear diligently my speech, and my
Book6Page48=Chapter 32\nSo these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. &l2&rThen was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram\: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself
Book3Page23=excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? &l12&rYour remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. &l13&rHold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will. &l14&rWherefore do I take my flesh in
Book6Page47=thereof to lose their life\: &l40&rLet thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
Book3Page22=him? &l8&rWill ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? &l9&rIs it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? &l10&rHe will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. &l11&rShall not his
Book6Page46=&l37&rI would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. &l38&rIf my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; &l39&rIf I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners
Book3Page21=of lies, ye are all physicians of no value. &l5&rO that ye would altogether hold your peace\! and it should be your wisdom. &l6&rHear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. &l7&rWill ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for
Book6Page45=I kept silence, and went not out of the door? &l35&rOh that one would hear me\! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. &l36&rSurely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
Book3Page20=Chapter 13\nLo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it. &l2&rWhat ye know, the same do I know also\: I am not inferior unto you. &l3&rSurely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. &l4&rBut ye are forgers
Book6Page44=&l32&rThe stranger did not lodge in the street\: but I opened my doors to the traveller. &l33&rIf I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom\: &l34&rDid I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that
Book6Page43=at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him\: &l30&rNeither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. &l31&rIf the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh\! we cannot be satisfied.
Book6Page42=it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; &l27&rAnd my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand\: &l28&rThis also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge\: for I should have denied the God that is above. &l29&rIf I rejoiced
Book6Page41=by reason of his highness I could not endure. &l24&rIf I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; &l25&rIf I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; &l26&rIf I beheld the sun when
Book6Page40=fleece of my sheep; &l21&rIf I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate\: &l22&rThen let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. &l23&rFor destruction from God was a terror to me, and
Book2Page49=marvellous upon me. &l17&rThou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me. &l18&rWherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had
Book2Page48=iniquity. &l15&rIf I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction; &l16&rFor it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion\: and again thou shewest thyself
Book2Page47=&l12&rThou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. &l13&rAnd these things hast thou hid in thine heart\: I know that this is with thee. &l14&rIf I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine
Book2Page46=beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? &l10&rHast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? &l11&rThou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
Book2Page45=after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? &l7&rThou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. &l8&rThine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. &l9&rRemember, I
Book2Page44=oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? &l4&rHast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? &l5&rAre thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, &l6&rThat thou inquirest
Book2Page43=Chapter 10\nMy soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. &l2&rI will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. &l3&rIs it good unto thee that thou shouldest
Book2Page42=that might lay his hand upon us both. &l34&rLet him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me\: &l35&rThen would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
Book2Page41=my hands never so clean; &l31&rYet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. &l32&rFor he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. &l33&rNeither is there any daysman betwixt us,
Book2Page40=will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself\: &l28&rI am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. &l29&rIf I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? &l30&rIf I wash myself with snow water, and make
Book3Page19=drunken man.
Book3Page18=nations, and straiteneth them again. &l24&rHe taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way. &l25&rThey grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a
Book3Page17=&l21&rHe poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. &l22&rHe discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. &l23&rHe increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them\: he enlargeth the
Book3Page16=the judges fools. &l18&rHe looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. &l19&rHe leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. &l20&rHe removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
Book3Page9=eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
Book3Page15=opening. &l15&rBehold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up\: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. &l16&rWith him is strength and wisdom\: the deceived and the deceiver are his. &l17&rHe leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh
Book6Page39=youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) &l19&rIf I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; &l20&rIf his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the
Book3Page8=the morning. &l18&rAnd thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. &l19&rAlso thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee. &l20&rBut the
Book3Page14=&l12&rWith the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. &l13&rWith him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. &l14&rBehold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again\: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no
Book6Page38=make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? &l16&rIf I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; &l17&rOr have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; &l18&r(For from my
Book3Page7=up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear\: &l16&rBecause thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away\: &l17&rAnd thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as
Book3Page13=shall declare unto thee. &l9&rWho knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? &l10&rIn whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. &l11&rDoth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
Book6Page37=all mine increase. &l13&rIf I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; &l14&rWhat then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? &l15&rDid not he that made me in the womb
Book3Page6=wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt. &l13&rIf thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; &l14&rIf iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. &l15&rFor then shalt thou lift
Book3Page12=provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. &l7&rBut ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee\: &l8&rOr speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee\: and the fishes of the sea
Book6Page36=neighbour's door; &l10&rThen let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. &l11&rFor this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. &l12&rFor it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out
Book3Page5=thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. &l10&rIf he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? &l11&rFor he knoweth vain men\: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? &l12&rFor vain man would be
Book3Page11=neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him\: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. &l5&rHe that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. &l6&rThe tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that
Book6Page35=of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; &l8&rThen let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. &l9&rIf mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my
Book3Page4=God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. &l7&rCanst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? &l8&rIt is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? &l9&rThe measure
Book3Page10=Chapter 12\nAnd Job answered and said, &l2&rNo doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. &l3&rBut I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you\: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? &l4&rI am as one mocked of his
Book6Page34=workers of iniquity? &l4&rDoth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? &l5&rIf I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; &l6&rLet me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. &l7&rIf my step hath turned out
Book3Page3=&l4&rFor thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. &l5&rBut oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; &l6&rAnd that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is\! Know therefore that
Book6Page33=Chapter 31\nI made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? &l2&rFor what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? &l3&rIs not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the
Book3Page2=Chapter 11\nThen answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, &l2&rShould not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? &l3&rShould thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
Book6Page32=of them that weep.
Book3Page1=Chapter 10 Cont.\nBefore I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; &l22&rA land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
Book6Page31=without the sun\: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. &l29&rI am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. &l30&rMy skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. &l31&rMy harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice
Book6Page30=trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? &l26&rWhen I looked for good, then evil came unto me\: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. &l27&rMy bowels boiled, and rested not\: the days of affliction prevented me. &l28&rI went mourning
Book2Page39=covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? &l25&rNow my days are swifter than a post\: they flee away, they see no good. &l26&rThey are passed away as the swift ships\: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. &l27&rIf I say, I
Book2Page38=soul\: I would despise my life. &l22&rThis is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. &l23&rIf the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. &l24&rThe earth is given into the hand of the wicked\: he
Book2Page37=strength, lo, he is strong\: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? &l20&rIf I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me\: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. &l21&rThough I were perfect, yet would I not know my
Book2Page36=answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. &l17&rFor he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. &l18&rHe will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. &l19&rIf I speak of
Book2Page35=helpers do stoop under him. &l14&rHow much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? &l15&rWhom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. &l16&rIf I had called, and he had
Book2Page34=wonders without number. &l11&rLo, he goeth by me, and I see him not\: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. &l12&rBehold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? &l13&rIf God will not withdraw his anger, the proud
Book2Page33=not; and sealeth up the stars. &l8&rWhich alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. &l9&rWhich maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. &l10&rWhich doeth great things past finding out; yea, and
Book2Page32=himself against him, and hath prospered? &l5&rWhich removeth the mountains, and they know not\: which overturneth them in his anger. &l6&rWhich shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. &l7&rWhich commandeth the sun, and it riseth
Book2Page31=Chapter 9\nThen Job answered and said, &l2&rI know it is so of a truth\: but how should man be just with God? &l3&rIf he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. &l4&rHe is wise in heart, and mighty in strength\: who hath hardened
Book2Page30=&l21&rTill he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. &l22&rThey that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
Book6Page29=dissolvest my substance. &l23&rFor I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. &l24&rHowbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. &l25&rDid not I weep for him that was in
Book6Page28=&l20&rI cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me\: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. &l21&rThou art become cruel to me\: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. &l22&rThou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and
Book6Page27=bones are pierced in me in the night season\: and my sinews take no rest. &l18&rBy the great force of my disease is my garment changed\: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. &l19&rHe hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
Book6Page26=desolation they rolled themselves upon me. &l15&rTerrors are turned upon me\: they pursue my soul as the wind\: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. &l16&rAnd now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. &l17&rMy
Book6Page25=right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. &l13&rThey mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. &l14&rThey came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters\: in the
Book6Page24=earth. &l9&rAnd now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. &l10&rThey abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. &l11&rBecause he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. &l12&rUpon my
Book6Page23=&l6&rTo dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. &l7&rAmong the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. &l8&rThey were children of fools, yea, children of base men\: they were viler than the
Book6Page22=famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. &l4&rWho cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. &l5&rThey were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
Book6Page21=Chapter 30\nBut now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. &l2&rYea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? &l3&rFor want and
Book6Page20=way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
Book2Page29=him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. &l19&rBehold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. &l20&rBehold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers\:
Book2Page28=his house, but it shall not stand\: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. &l16&rHe is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. &l17&rHis roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. &l18&rIf he destroy
Book2Page27=his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. &l13&rSo are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish\: &l14&rWhose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. &l15&rHe shall lean upon
Book2Page26=yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow\:) &l10&rShall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? &l11&rCan the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? &l12&rWhilst it is yet in
Book2Page25=habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. &l7&rThough thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. &l8&rFor inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers\: &l9&r(For we are but of
Book2Page24=have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; &l5&rIf thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; &l6&rIf thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the
Book2Page23=Chapter 8\nThen answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, &l2&rHow long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? &l3&rDoth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? &l4&rIf thy children
Book2Page22=and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
Book2Page21=sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? &l21&rAnd why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust;
Book2Page20=magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? &l18&rAnd that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? &l19&rHow long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? &l20&rI have
Book6Page19=speech dropped upon them. &l23&rAnd they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. &l24&rIf I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. &l25&rI chose out their
Book6Page18=spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. &l20&rMy glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. &l21&rUnto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. &l22&rAfter my words they spake not again; and my
Book6Page17=father to the poor\: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. &l17&rAnd I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. &l18&rThen I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. &l19&rMy root was
Book6Page16=him that was ready to perish came upon me\: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. &l14&rI put on righteousness, and it clothed me\: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. &l15&rI was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. &l16&rI was a
Book6Page15=cleaved to the roof of their mouth. &l11&rWhen the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me\: &l12&rBecause I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. &l13&rThe blessing of
Book6Page14=city, when I prepared my seat in the street\! &l8&rThe young men saw me, and hid themselves\: and the aged arose, and stood up. &l9&rThe princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. &l10&rThe nobles held their peace, and their tongue
Book6Page13=youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; &l5&rWhen the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; &l6&rWhen I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; &l7&rWhen I went out to the gate through the
Book6Page12=Chapter 29\nMoreover Job continued his parable, and said, &l2&rOh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; &l3&rWhen his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; &l4&rAs I was in the days of my
Book6Page11=for the lightning of the thunder\: &l27&rThen did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. &l28&rAnd unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
Book6Page10=thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. &l24&rFor he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven; &l25&rTo make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. &l26&rWhen he made a decree for the rain, and a way
Book2Page19=scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions\: &l15&rSo that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. &l16&rI loathe it; I would not live alway\: let me alone; for my days are vanity. &l17&rWhat is man, that thou shouldest
Book2Page18=mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. &l12&rAm I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? &l13&rWhen I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; &l14&rThen thou
Book2Page17=upon me, and I am not. &l9&rAs the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away\: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. &l10&rHe shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. &l11&rTherefore I will not refrain my

Book5Page26=ox for a pledge. &l4&rThey turn the needy out of the way\: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. &l5&rBehold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey\: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their
Book5Page25=Chapter 24\nWhy, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? &l2&rSome remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. &l3&rThey drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's
Book8Page49=&l16&rOne is so near to another, that no air can come between them. &l17&rThey are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. &l18&rBy his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Book5Page24=&l15&rTherefore am I troubled at his presence\: when I consider, I am afraid of him. &l16&rFor God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me\: &l17&rBecause I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
Book8Page48=proportion. &l13&rWho can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? &l14&rWho can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. &l15&rHis scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
Book5Page23=the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. &l13&rBut he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. &l14&rFor he performeth the thing that is appointed for me\: and many such things are with him.
Book8Page47=&l10&rNone is so fierce that dare stir him up\: who then is able to stand before me? &l11&rWho hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. &l12&rI will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
Book5Page22=see him\: &l10&rBut he knoweth the way that I take\: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. &l11&rMy foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. &l12&rNeither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed
Book8Page46=among the merchants? &l7&rCanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? &l8&rLay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. &l9&rBehold, the hope of him is in vain\: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
Book5Page21=should I be delivered for ever from my judge. &l8&rBehold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him\: &l9&rOn the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him\: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot
Book8Page45=words unto thee? &l4&rWill he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? &l5&rWilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? &l6&rShall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him
Book5Page20=with arguments. &l5&rI would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. &l6&rWill he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. &l7&rThere the righteous might dispute with him; so
Book8Page44=Chapter 41\nCanst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? &l2&rCanst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? &l3&rWill he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
Book8Page43=shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. &l23&rBehold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not\: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. &l24&rHe taketh it with his eyes\: his nose pierceth through snares.
Book8Page42=him can make his sword to approach unto him. &l20&rSurely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. &l21&rHe lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. &l22&rThe shady trees cover him with their
Book8Page41=force is in the navel of his belly. &l17&rHe moveth his tail like a cedar\: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. &l18&rHis bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. &l19&rHe is the chief of the ways of God\: he that made
Book1Page29=which built desolate places for themselves; &l15&rOr with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver\: &l16&rOr as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. &l17&rThere the wicked cease from troubling; and
Book8Page40=together; and bind their faces in secret. &l14&rThen will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. &l15&rBehold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. &l16&rLo now, his strength is in his loins, and his
Book1Page28=when I came out of the belly? &l12&rWhy did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? &l13&rFor now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept\: then had I been at rest, &l14&rWith kings and counsellers of the earth,
Book1Page27=thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day\: &l10&rBecause it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. &l11&rWhy died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
Book1Page26=days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. &l7&rLo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. &l8&rLet them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. &l9&rLet the stars of the twilight
Book1Page25=it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. &l5&rLet darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. &l6&rAs for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the

Book1Page24=Chapter 3\nAfter this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. &l2&rAnd Job spake, and said, &l3&rLet the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. &l4&rLet that day be darkness; let not God regard

Book1Page23=saw that his grief was very great.

Book1Page22=knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. &l13&rSo they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him\: for they
Book4Page46=Chapter 21\nBut Job answered and said, &l2&rHear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. &l3&rSuffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. &l4&rAs for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my
Book1Page21=they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite\: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. &l12&rAnd when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and
Book4Page45=wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
Book1Page20=Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. &l11&rNow when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him,
Book4Page44=him that is left in his tabernacle. &l27&rThe heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. &l28&rThe increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. &l29&rThis is the portion of a
Book4Page43=shall strike him through. &l25&rIt is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall\: terrors are upon him. &l26&rAll darkness shall be hid in his secret places\: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with
Book4Page42=straits\: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. &l23&rWhen he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. &l24&rHe shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel
Book4Page41=builded not; &l20&rSurely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. &l21&rThere shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. &l22&rIn the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in
Book4Page40=for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down\: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. &l19&rBecause he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he
Book5Page19=Chapter 23\nThen Job answered and said, &l2&rEven to day is my complaint bitter\: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. &l3&rOh that I knew where I might find him\! that I might come even to his seat\! &l4&rI would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth
Book5Page18=then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. &l30&rHe shall deliver the island of the innocent\: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
Book5Page17=unto God. &l27&rThou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. &l28&rThou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee\: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. &l29&rWhen men are cast down,
Book5Page16=shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. &l25&rYea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. &l26&rFor then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face
Book5Page15=thereby good shall come unto thee. &l22&rReceive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. &l23&rIf thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. &l24&rThen
Book8Page39=thyself with glory and beauty. &l11&rCast abroad the rage of thy wrath\: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. &l12&rLook on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. &l13&rHide them in the dust
Book5Page14=the wicked is far from me. &l19&rThe righteous see it, and are glad\: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. &l20&rWhereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. &l21&rAcquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace\:
Book8Page38=declare thou unto me. &l8&rWilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? &l9&rHast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? &l10&rDeck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
Book5Page13=men have trodden? &l16&rWhich were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood\: &l17&rWhich said unto God, Depart from us\: and what can the Almighty do for them? &l18&rYet he filled their houses with good things\: but the counsel of
Book8Page37=lay mine hand upon my mouth. &l5&rOnce have I spoken; but I will not answer\: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. &l6&rThen answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, &l7&rGird up thy loins now like a man\: I will demand of thee, and
Book5Page12=stars, how high they are\! &l13&rAnd thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? &l14&rThick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. &l15&rHast thou marked the old way which wicked
Book8Page36=Chapter 40\nMoreover the LORD answered Job, and said, &l2&rShall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. &l3&rThen Job answered the LORD, and said, &l4&rBehold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will
Book5Page11=fatherless have been broken. &l10&rTherefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; &l11&rOr darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. &l12&rIs not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the
Book8Page35=the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. &l29&rFrom thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. &l30&rHer young ones also suck up blood\: and where the slain are, there is she.
Book5Page10=clothing. &l7&rThou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. &l8&rBut as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. &l9&rThou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the
Book8Page34=the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. &l26&rDoth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? &l27&rDoth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? &l28&rShe dwelleth and abideth on
Book8Page33=sword. &l23&rThe quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. &l24&rHe swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage\: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. &l25&rHe saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth
Book8Page32=make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. &l21&rHe paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength\: he goeth on to meet the armed men. &l22&rHe mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the
Book8Page31=deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. &l18&rWhat time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. &l19&rHast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? &l20&rCanst thou
Book8Page30=and warmeth them in dust, &l15&rAnd forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. &l16&rShe is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers\: her labour is in vain without fear; &l17&rBecause God hath
Book1Page19=from the sole of his foot unto his crown. &l8&rAnd he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. &l9&rThen said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. &l10&rBut he said unto her,
Book1Page18=thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. &l6&rAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. &l7&rSo went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils
Book1Page17=escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. &l4&rAnd Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. &l5&rBut put forth
Book1Page16=said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. &l3&rAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and
Book1Page15=Chapter 2\nAgain there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. &l2&rAnd the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and
Book4Page39=and he shall vomit them up again\: God shall cast them out of his belly. &l16&rHe shall suck the poison of asps\: the viper's tongue shall slay him. &l17&rHe shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. &l18&rThat which he laboured
Book1Page14=shall I return thither\: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. &l22&rIn all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
Book4Page38=sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; &l13&rThough he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth\: &l14&rYet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. &l15&rHe hath swallowed down riches,
Book1Page13=upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. &l20&rThen Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, &l21&rAnd said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
Book4Page37=neither shall his place any more behold him. &l10&rHis children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. &l11&rHis bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. &l12&rThough wickedness be
Book1Page12=yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house\: &l19&rAnd, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell
Book4Page36=perish for ever like his own dung\: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? &l8&rHe shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found\: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. &l9&rThe eye also which saw him shall see him no more;
Book1Page11=yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. &l18&rWhile he was
Book4Page35=not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, &l5&rThat the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? &l6&rThough his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; &l7&rYet he shall
Book1Page10=alone to tell thee. &l16&rWhile he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. &l17&rWhile he was
Book4Page34=Chapter 20\nThen answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, &l2&rTherefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. &l3&rI have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. &l4&rKnowest thou
Book4Page33=know there is a judgment.
Book4Page32=shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. &l28&rBut ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? &l29&rBe ye afraid of the sword\: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may
Book4Page31=the rock for ever\! &l25&rFor I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth\: &l26&rAnd though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God\: &l27&rWhom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
Book4Page30=friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. &l22&rWhy do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? &l23&rOh that my words were now written\! oh that they were printed in a book\! &l24&rThat they were graven with an iron pen and lead in
Book7Page50=the cloud that cometh betwixt. &l33&rThe noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
Book8Page29=leave thy labour to him? &l12&rWilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? &l13&rGavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? &l14&rWhich leaveth her eggs in the earth,
Book8Page28=thing. &l9&rWill the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? &l10&rCanst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? &l11&rWilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou
Book8Page27=&l6&rWhose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. &l7&rHe scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. &l8&rThe range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green

Book8Page25=Chapter 39\nKnowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? &l2&rCanst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? &l3&rThey bow themselves, they
Book8Page24=dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? &l41&rWho provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
Book8Page23=clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, &l38&rWhen the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? &l39&rWilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, &l40&rWhen they couch in their
Book8Page22=clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? &l35&rCanst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are? &l36&rWho hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? &l37&rWho can number the
Book8Page21=bands of Orion? &l32&rCanst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? &l33&rKnowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? &l34&rCanst thou lift up thy voice to the
Book8Page20=the drops of dew? &l29&rOut of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? &l30&rThe waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. &l31&rCanst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
Book4Page29=spake against me. &l19&rAll my inward friends abhorred me\: and they whom I loved are turned against me. &l20&rMy bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. &l21&rHave pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my
Book4Page28=their sight. &l16&rI called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. &l17&rMy breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. &l18&rYea, young children despised me; I arose, and they
Book4Page27=hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. &l14&rMy kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. &l15&rThey that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger\: I am an alien in
Book4Page26=mine hope hath he removed like a tree. &l11&rHe hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. &l12&rHis troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. &l13&rHe
Book7Page49=the noise of his tabernacle? &l30&rBehold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. &l31&rFor by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. &l32&rWith clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by
Book4Page25=aloud, but there is no judgment. &l8&rHe hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. &l9&rHe hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. &l10&rHe hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone\: and
Book7Page48=of his years be searched out. &l27&rFor he maketh small the drops of water\: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof\: &l28&rWhich the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. &l29&rAlso can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or
Book4Page24=error remaineth with myself. &l5&rIf indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach\: &l6&rKnow now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. &l7&rBehold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard\: I cry
Book7Page47=enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? &l24&rRemember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. &l25&rEvery man may see it; man may behold it afar off. &l26&rBehold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number
Book4Page23=Chapter 19\nThen Job answered and said, &l2&rHow long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? &l3&rThese ten times have ye reproached me\: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. &l4&rAnd be it indeed that I have erred, mine
Book7Page46=forces of strength. &l20&rDesire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. &l21&rTake heed, regard not iniquity\: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. &l22&rBehold, God exalteth by his power\: who teacheth like him? &l23&rWho hath
Book4Page22=before were affrighted. &l21&rSurely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
Book7Page45=fulfilled the judgment of the wicked\: judgment and justice take hold on thee. &l18&rBecause there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke\: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. &l19&rWill he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the
Book4Page21=&l18&rHe shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. &l19&rHe shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. &l20&rThey that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went
Book7Page44=affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. &l16&rEven so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. &l17&rBut thou hast
Book4Page20=because it is none of his\: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. &l16&rHis roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off. &l17&rHis remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
Book7Page43=they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. &l13&rBut the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath\: they cry not when he bindeth them. &l14&rThey die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. &l15&rHe delivereth the poor in his
Book7Page42=that they have exceeded. &l10&rHe openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. &l11&rIf they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. &l12&rBut if they obey not,
Book7Page41=the righteous\: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. &l8&rAnd if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; &l9&rThen he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions
Book7Page40=false\: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. &l5&rBehold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any\: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. &l6&rHe preserveth not the life of the wicked\: but giveth right to the poor. &l7&rHe withdraweth not his eyes from
Book8Page19=&l26&rTo cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; &l27&rTo satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? &l28&rHath the rain a father? or who hath begotten
Book8Page18=the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? &l24&rBy what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? &l25&rWho hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
Book6Page9=wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? &l21&rSeeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. &l22&rDestruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. &l23&rGod understandeth the way
Book6Page8=of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. &l18&rNo mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls\: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. &l19&rThe topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. &l20&rWhence then cometh
Book8Page17=to the house thereof? &l21&rKnowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? &l22&rHast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, &l23&rWhich I have reserved against
Book8Page16=perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. &l19&rWhere is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, &l20&rThat thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths
Book6Page7=with me. &l15&rIt cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. &l16&rIt cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. &l17&rThe gold and the crystal cannot equal it\: and the exchange
Book6Page6=he forth to light. &l12&rBut where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? &l13&rMan knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. &l14&rThe depth saith, It is not in me\: and the sea saith, It is not
Book8Page15=and the high arm shall be broken. &l16&rHast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? &l17&rHave the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? &l18&rHast thou
Book8Page14=the dayspring to know his place; &l13&rThat it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? &l14&rIt is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. &l15&rAnd from the wicked their light is withholden,
Book6Page5=&l9&rHe putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. &l10&rHe cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. &l11&rHe bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth
Book6Page4=fire. &l6&rThe stones of it are the place of sapphires\: and it hath dust of gold. &l7&rThere is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen\: &l8&rThe lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
Book8Page13=swaddlingband for it, &l10&rAnd brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, &l11&rAnd said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further\: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? &l12&rHast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused
Book8Page12=&l7&rWhen the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? &l8&rOr who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? &l9&rWhen I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a
Book6Page3=darkness, and the shadow of death. &l4&rThe flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot\: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. &l5&rAs for the earth, out of it cometh bread\: and under it is turned up as it were
Book6Page2=Chapter 28\nSurely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. &l2&rIron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. &l3&rHe setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection\: the stones of
Book8Page11=the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. &l5&rWho hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? &l6&rWhereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Book8Page10=Chapter 38\nThen the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, &l2&rWho is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? &l3&rGird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. &l4&rWhere wast thou when I laid

Book4Page19=side. &l13&rIt shall devour the strength of his skin\: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. &l14&rHis confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. &l15&rIt shall dwell in his tabernacle,
Book4Page18=against him. &l10&rThe snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. &l11&rTerrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. &l12&rHis strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his
Book4Page17=out with him. &l7&rThe steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. &l8&rFor he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. &l9&rThe gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail
Book4Page16=shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? &l5&rYea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. &l6&rThe light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put
Book4Page15=Chapter 18\nThen answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, &l2&rHow long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. &l3&rWherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? &l4&rHe teareth himself in his anger\:
Book7Page39=Chapter 36\nElihu also proceeded, and said, &l2&rSuffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. &l3&rI will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. &l4&rFor truly my words shall not be
Book4Page14=is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? &l16&rThey shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
Book7Page38=in him. &l15&rBut now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity\: &l16&rTherefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Book7Page37=&l12&rThere they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. &l13&rSurely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. &l14&rAlthough thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou
Book4Page13=the night into day\: the light is short because of darkness. &l13&rIf I wait, the grave is mine house\: I have made my bed in the darkness. &l14&rI have said to corruption, Thou art my father\: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. &l15&rAnd where
Book4Page12=he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. &l10&rBut as for you all, do ye return, and come now\: for I cannot find one wise man among you. &l11&rMy days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. &l12&rThey change
Book7Page36=oppressed to cry\: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. &l10&rBut none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; &l11&rWho teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
Book7Page35=him? &l7&rIf thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? &l8&rThy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. &l9&rBy reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
Book4Page11=was as a tabret. &l7&rMine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. &l8&rUpright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. &l9&rThe righteous also shall hold on his way, and
Book4Page10=with me? &l4&rFor thou hast hid their heart from understanding\: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. &l5&rHe that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. &l6&rHe hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I
Book7Page34=&l4&rI will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. &l5&rLook unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. &l6&rIf thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto
Book7Page33=Chapter 35\nElihu spake moreover, and said, &l2&rThinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? &l3&rFor thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
Book7Page32=desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. &l37&rFor he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
Book7Page31=whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I\: therefore speak what thou knowest. &l34&rLet men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. &l35&rJob hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. &l36&rMy
Book7Page30=&l31&rSurely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more\: &l32&rThat which I see not teach thou me\: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. &l33&rShould it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
Book7Page29=afflicted. &l29&rWhen he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only\: &l30&rThat the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
Book7Page28=destroyed. &l26&rHe striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; &l27&rBecause they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways\: &l28&rSo that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the
Book7Page27=man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. &l24&rHe shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. &l25&rTherefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are
Book7Page26=and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. &l21&rFor his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. &l22&rThere is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. &l23&rFor he will not lay upon
Book7Page25=ungodly? &l19&rHow much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. &l20&rIn a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away\:
Book7Page24=dust. &l16&rIf now thou hast understanding, hear this\: hearken to the voice of my words. &l17&rShall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? &l18&rIs it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are
Book7Page23=judgment. &l13&rWho hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? &l14&rIf he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; &l15&rAll flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
Book7Page22=wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. &l11&rFor the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. &l12&rYea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert
Book7Page21=company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. &l9&rFor he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. &l10&rTherefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding\: far be it from God, that he should do
Book7Page20=is good. &l5&rFor Job hath said, I am righteous\: and God hath taken away my judgment. &l6&rShould I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. &l7&rWhat man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? &l8&rWhich goeth in
Book7Page19=Chapter 34\nFurthermore Elihu answered and said, &l2&rHear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. &l3&rFor the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. &l4&rLet us choose to us judgment\: let us know among ourselves what
Book7Page18=me\: speak, for I desire to justify thee. &l33&rIf not, hearken unto me\: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
Book7Page17=these things worketh God oftentimes with man, &l30&rTo bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. &l31&rMark well, O Job, hearken unto me\: hold thy peace, and I will speak. &l32&rIf thou hast any thing to say, answer
Book7Page16=render unto man his righteousness. &l27&rHe looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; &l28&rHe will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. &l29&rLo, all
Book7Page15=going down to the pit\: I have found a ransom. &l25&rHis flesh shall be fresher than a child's\: he shall return to the days of his youth\: &l26&rHe shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him\: and he shall see his face with joy\: for he will
Book7Page14=&l22&rYea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. &l23&rIf there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness\: &l24&rThen he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from
Book7Page13=chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain\: &l20&rSo that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. &l21&rHis flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
Book7Page12=upon the bed; &l16&rThen he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, &l17&rThat he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. &l18&rHe keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. &l19&rHe is
Book7Page11=man. &l13&rWhy dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. &l14&rFor God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. &l15&rIn a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings
Book7Page10=is there iniquity in me. &l10&rBehold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, &l11&rHe putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. &l12&rBehold, in this thou art not just\: I will answer thee, that God is greater than
Book5Page9=ways perfect? &l4&rWill he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? &l5&rIs not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? &l6&rFor thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their

Book5Page6=tokens, &l30&rThat the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. &l31&rWho shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? &l32&rYet shall he be brought to the grave, and
Book5Page5=know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. &l28&rFor ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? &l29&rHave ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their

Ch7=B2P22
Book5Page2=stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. &l19&rGod layeth up his iniquity for his children\: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. &l20&rHis eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

Book5Page1=Chapter 21 Cont.\nLo, their good is not in their hand\: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. &l17&rHow oft is the candle of the wicked put out\! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them\! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. &l18&rThey are as

Book4Page9=Chapter 17\nMy breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. &l2&rAre there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? &l3&rLay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands

Book4Page6=cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. &l14&rHe breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant. &l15&rI have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. &l16&rMy face
Book4Page5=me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. &l12&rI was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder\: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. &l13&rHis archers compass me round about, he
Book4Page4=me\: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. &l10&rThey have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. &l11&rGod hath delivered
Book4Page3=&l7&rBut now he hath made me weary\: thou hast made desolate all my company. &l8&rAnd thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me\: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. &l9&rHe teareth me in his wrath, who hateth
Book4Page2=stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. &l5&rBut I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. &l6&rThough I speak, my grief is not asswaged\: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
Book4Page1=Chapter 16\nThen Job answered and said, &l2&rI have heard many such things\: miserable comforters are ye all. &l3&rShall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? &l4&rI also could speak as ye do\: if your soul were in my soul's

Book3Page48=neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. &l30&rHe shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. &l31&rLet not him that is deceived trust in vanity\: for vanity
Book3Page47=covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. &l28&rAnd he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. &l29&rHe shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
Book3Page46=prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. &l25&rFor he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. &l26&rHe runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers\: &l27&rBecause he
Book3Page45=not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword. &l23&rHe wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. &l24&rTrouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall

Book3Page43=more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? &l17&rI will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; &l18&rWhich wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it\: &l19&rUnto whom alone the earth was
Book3Page42=lettest such words go out of thy mouth? &l14&rWhat is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? &l15&rBehold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. &l16&rHow much
Book3Page41=very aged men, much elder than thy father. &l11&rAre the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? &l12&rWhy doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, &l13&rThat thou turnest thy spirit against God, and
Book3Page40=was born? or wast thou made before the hills? &l8&rHast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? &l9&rWhat knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? &l10&rWith us are both the grayheaded and
Book3Page39=off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. &l5&rFor thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. &l6&rThine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I\: yea, thine own lips testify against thee. &l7&rArt thou the first man that
Book3Page38=Chapter 15\nThen answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, &l2&rShould a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? &l3&rShould he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? &l4&rYea, thou castest

Book3Page36=&l19&rThe waters wear the stones\: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. &l20&rThou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth\: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
Book3Page35=&l16&rFor now thou numberest my steps\: dost thou not watch over my sin? &l17&rMy transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. &l18&rAnd surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.
Book3Page34=wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me\! &l14&rIf a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. &l15&rThou shalt call, and I will answer thee\: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
