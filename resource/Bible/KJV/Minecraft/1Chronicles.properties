Book3Page26=he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bare a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house. &l24&r(And his daughter was Sherah, who built Bethhoron the nether, and the upper, and Uzzensherah.) &l25&rAnd Rephah was his son,
Book3Page25=son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead, whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came down to take away their cattle. &l22&rAnd Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren came to comfort him. &l23&rAnd when

Book6Page48=Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. &l9&rNow when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; &l10&rHe sent Hadoram his son
Book3Page23=a son, and she called his name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his sons were Ulam and Rakem. &l17&rAnd the sons of Ulam; Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh. &l18&rAnd his sister Hammoleketh
Book6Page47=David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. &l7&rAnd David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. &l8&rLikewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of
Book3Page22=Aramitess bare Machir the father of Gilead\: &l15&rAnd Machir took to wife the sister of Huppim and Shuppim, whose sister's name was Maachah;) and the name of the second was Zelophehad\: and Zelophehad had daughters. &l16&rAnd Maachah the wife of Machir bare

Book6Page44=Chapter 18\nNow after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. &l2&rAnd he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. &l3&rAnd
Book6Page43=ever\: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.
Book6Page42=therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. &l26&rAnd now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant\: &l27&rNow therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for
Book6Page41=thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel\: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee. &l25&rFor thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house\:
Book6Page40=people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. &l23&rTherefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. &l24&rLet it even be established, that

Book2Page31=&l25&rAnd they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them. &l26&rAnd the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of

Book6Page29=since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. &l6&rWheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people,
Book6Page28=heart; for God is with thee. &l3&rAnd it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, &l4&rGo and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in\: &l5&rFor I have not dwelt in an house
Book6Page27=Chapter 17\nNow it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains. &l2&rThen Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine
Book6Page26=that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. &l43&rAnd all the people departed every man to his house\: and David returned to bless his house.
Book6Page25=commanded Israel; &l41&rAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; &l42&rAnd with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those

Book6Page22=thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. &l36&rBlessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. &l37&rSo he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to
Book9Page46=chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, &l12&rAnd the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of
Book6Page21=LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. &l34&rO give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. &l35&rAnd say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
Book9Page45=&l10&rTake heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary\: be strong, and do it. &l11&rThen David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper
Book6Page20=glad, and let the earth rejoice\: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. &l32&rLet the sea roar, and the fulness thereof\: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. &l33&rThen shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the

Book9Page41=of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel\: &l5&rAnd of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. &l6&rAnd he said unto me, Solomon thy
Book2Page29=hundred thousand. &l22&rFor there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. &l23&rAnd the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land\: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and
Book9Page40=man of war, and hast shed blood. &l4&rHowbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever\: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons
Book2Page28=they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. &l21&rAnd they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an
Book2Page27=hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. &l19&rAnd they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. &l20&rAnd they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them\: for

Book5Page46=the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. &l13&rFor because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. &l14&rSo the priests and the Levites
Book10Page2=weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. &l19&rAll this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of
Book5Page45=and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, &l12&rAnd said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites\: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up
Book10Page1=Chapter 28 Cont.\nAlso pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups\: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver\: &l18&rAnd for the altar of incense refined gold by

Book5Page41=Chapter 15\nAnd David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. &l2&rThen David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites\: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God,
Book5Page40=him upon all nations.
Book1Page49=and Ishma, and Idbash\: and the name of their sister was Hazelelponi\: &l4&rAnd Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah. These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the father of Bethlehem. &l5&rAnd Ashur the father of Tekoa had

Book1Page42=and Eliada, and Eliphelet, nine. &l9&rThese were all the sons of David, beside the sons of the concubines, and Tamar their sister. &l10&rAnd Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son, &l11&rJoram his son, Ahaziah his son,
Book1Page41=and three years. &l5&rAnd these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel\: &l6&rIbhar also, and Elishama, and Eliphelet, &l7&rAnd Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, &l8&rAnd Elishama,

Book5Page39=before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. &l16&rDavid therefore did as God commanded him\: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. &l17&rAnd the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of
Book5Page38=him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. &l15&rAnd it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle\: for God is gone forth
Book5Page37=Baalperazim. &l12&rAnd when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. &l13&rAnd the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. &l14&rTherefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto
Book5Page36=for I will deliver them into thine hand. &l11&rSo they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters\: therefore they called the name of that place
Book5Page35=out against them. &l9&rAnd the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. &l10&rAnd David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up;
Book5Page34=Elpalet, &l6&rAnd Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, &l7&rAnd Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. &l8&rAnd when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went
Book5Page33=of his people Israel. &l3&rAnd David took more wives at Jerusalem\: and David begat more sons and daughters. &l4&rNow these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, &l5&rAnd Ibhar, and Elishua, and
Book5Page32=Chapter 14\nNow Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. &l2&rAnd David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because
Book5Page31=the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
Book5Page30=home to me? &l13&rSo David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. &l14&rAnd the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed
Book8Page50=brethren, were twelve.
Book1Page39=Chapter 3\nNow these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess\: &l2&rThe third, Absalom the son of Maachah the daughter of Talmai king of

Book1Page36=&l52&rAnd Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and half of the Manahethites. &l53&rAnd the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites.
Book1Page35=Machbenah, and the father of Gibea\: and the daughter of Caleb was Achsah. &l50&rThese were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah; Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim, &l51&rSalma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of Bethgader.
Book1Page34=Haran begat Gazez. &l47&rAnd the sons of Jahdai; Regem, and Jotham, and Geshan, and Pelet, and Ephah, and Shaaph. &l48&rMaachah, Caleb's concubine, bare Sheber, and Tirhanah. &l49&rShe bare also Shaaph the father of Madmannah, Sheva the father of
Book1Page33=Tappuah, and Rekem, and Shema. &l44&rAnd Shema begat Raham, the father of Jorkoam\: and Rekem begat Shammai. &l45&rAnd the son of Shammai was Maon\: and Maon was the father of Bethzur. &l46&rAnd Ephah, Caleb's concubine, bare Haran, and Moza, and Gazez\: and
Book7Page9=thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. &l8&rAnd when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and
Book1Page32=Shallum begat Jekamiah, and Jekamiah begat Elishama. &l42&rNow the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were, Mesha his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron. &l43&rAnd the sons of Hebron; Korah, and
Book7Page8=the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah. &l7&rSo they hired
Book1Page31=Nathan begat Zabad, &l37&rAnd Zabad begat Ephlal, and Ephlal begat Obed, &l38&rAnd Obed begat Jehu, and Jehu begat Azariah, &l39&rAnd Azariah begat Helez, and Helez begat Eleasah, &l40&rAnd Eleasah begat Sisamai, and Sisamai begat Shallum, &l41&rAnd
Book7Page7=buttocks, and sent them away. &l5&rThen there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them\: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. &l6&rAnd when
Book1Page30=sons of Jerahmeel. &l34&rNow Sheshan had no sons, but daughters. And Sheshan had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Jarha. &l35&rAnd Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife; and she bare him Attai. &l36&rAnd Attai begat Nathan, and
Book7Page6=father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? &l4&rWherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their
Book7Page5=sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. &l3&rBut the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy
Book7Page4=Chapter 19\nNow it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. &l2&rAnd David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David
Book7Page3=Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; &l17&rAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
Book4Page50=Chapter 12\nNow these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish\: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
Book7Page2=&l14&rSo David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. &l15&rAnd Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. &l16&rAnd Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
Book7Page1=Chapter 18 Cont.\nMoreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. &l13&rAnd he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
Book5Page29=the ark\: and there he died before God. &l11&rAnd David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza\: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. &l12&rAnd David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God
Book5Page28=cymbals, and with trumpets. &l9&rAnd when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. &l10&rAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to
Book5Page27=carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab\: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. &l8&rAnd David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with
Book5Page26=God from Kirjathjearim. &l6&rAnd David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it. &l7&rAnd they
Book5Page25=it in the days of Saul. &l4&rAnd all the congregation said that they would do so\: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. &l5&rSo David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of
Book8Page49=twelve\: &l29&rThe two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l30&rThe three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l31&rThe four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his
Book5Page24=every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us\: &l3&rAnd let us bring again the ark of our God to us\: for we inquired not at

Book5Page23=Chapter 13\nAnd David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. &l2&rAnd David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren
Book8Page47=sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l23&rThe sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l24&rThe seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l25&rThe eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his

Book8Page44=his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l13&rThe sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l14&rThe seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve\: &l15&rThe eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren,

Book8Page41=under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. &l7&rSo the number of them, with their brethren that

Book5Page13=the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. &l24&rThe children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war. &l25&rOf the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven

Book5Page12=captains in the host. &l22&rFor at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God. &l23&rAnd these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn
Book8Page35=who had no sons. &l29&rConcerning Kish\: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel. &l30&rThe sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. &l31&rThese likewise cast lots over against their
Book5Page11=Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh. &l21&rAnd they helped David against the band of the rovers\: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were
Book8Page34=&l25&rThe brother of Michah was Isshiah\: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah. &l26&rThe sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi\: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. &l27&rThe sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. &l28&rOf Mahli came Eleazar,
Book5Page10=the Philistines against Saul to battle\: but they helped them not\: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads. &l20&rAs he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of
Book8Page33=&l22&rOf the Izharites; Shelomoth\: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. &l23&rAnd the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. &l24&rOf the sons of Uzziel; Michah\: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.
Book8Page32=Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. &l20&rAnd the rest of the sons of Levi were these\: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael\: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. &l21&rConcerning Rehabiah\: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.
Book8Page31=twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, &l18&rThe three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. &l19&rThese were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under
Book1Page19=Shua the Canaanitess. And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and he slew him. &l4&rAnd Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. &l5&rThe sons of Pharez; Hezron, and Hamul. &l6&rAnd
Book8Page30=&l13&rThe thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, &l14&rThe fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, &l15&rThe seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses, &l16&rThe nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, &l17&rThe one and
Book1Page18=Chapter 2\nThese are the sons of Israel; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, &l2&rDan, Joseph, and Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. &l3&rThe sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah\: which three were born unto him of the daughter of

Book1Page16=the name of his city was Pai; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. &l51&rHadad died also. And the dukes of Edom were; duke Timnah, duke Aliah, duke Jetheth, &l52&rDuke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
Book4Page39=these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. &l20&rAnd Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three\: for lifting up
Book1Page15=reigned in his stead. &l48&rAnd when Samlah was dead, Shaul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. &l49&rAnd when Shaul was dead, Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. &l50&rAnd when Baalhanan was dead, Hadad reigned in his stead\: and
Book4Page38=water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David\: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD, &l19&rAnd said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing\: shall I drink the blood of
Book1Page14=of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. &l46&rAnd when Husham was dead, Hadad the son of Bedad, which smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead\: and the name of his city was Avith. &l47&rAnd when Hadad was dead, Samlah of Masrekah
Book4Page37=hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem. &l17&rAnd David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate\! &l18&rAnd the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew
Book1Page13=in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel; Bela the son of Beor\: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. &l44&rAnd when Bela was dead, Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. &l45&rAnd when Jobab was dead, Husham
Book4Page36=Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance. &l15&rNow three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. &l16&rAnd David was then in the
Book1Page12=of Zibeon; Aiah, and Anah. &l41&rThe sons of Anah; Dishon. And the sons of Dishon; Amram, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. &l42&rThe sons of Ezer; Bilhan, and Zavan, and Jakan. The sons of Dishan; Uz, and Aran. &l43&rNow these are the kings that reigned
Book4Page35=Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. &l14&rAnd they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the
Book1Page11=the sons of Seir; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan. &l39&rAnd the sons of Lotan; Hori, and Homam\: and Timna was Lotan's sister. &l40&rThe sons of Shobal; Alian, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shephi, and Onam. And the sons
Book4Page34=Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains\: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time. &l12&rAnd after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties. &l13&rHe was with David at
Book1Page10=Esau and Israel. &l35&rThe sons of Esau; Eliphaz, Reuel, and Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. &l36&rThe sons of Eliphaz; Teman, and Omar, Zephi, and Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna, and Amalek. &l37&rThe sons of Reuel; Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. &l38&rAnd
Book4Page33=chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. &l11&rAnd this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
Book4Page32=therefore they called it the city of David. &l8&rAnd he built the city round about, even from Millo round about\: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. &l9&rSo David waxed greater and greater\: for the LORD of hosts was with him. &l10&rThese also are the
Book4Page31=Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David. &l6&rAnd David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. &l7&rAnd David dwelt in the castle;
Book4Page30=Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel. &l4&rAnd David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land. &l5&rAnd the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither.
Book7Page50=born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about\: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
Book8Page29=&l8&rThe third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, &l9&rThe fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, &l10&rThe seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, &l11&rThe ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, &l12&rThe eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
Book8Page28=priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites\: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. &l7&rNow the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
Book8Page27=governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. &l6&rAnd Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the
Book8Page26=were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. &l5&rThus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
Book8Page25=&l3&rAnd David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. &l4&rAnd there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus
Book8Page24=Chapter 24\nNow these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. &l2&rBut Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children\: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.
Book8Page23=brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
Book8Page22=feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD\: &l32&rAnd that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their
Book8Page21=that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; &l30&rAnd to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; &l31&rAnd to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set
Book8Page20=in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; &l29&rBoth for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for
Book4Page29=unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. &l3&rTherefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over
Book4Page28=Chapter 11\nThen all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. &l2&rAnd moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel\: and the LORD thy God said
Book4Page27=the son of Jesse.
Book4Page26=committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it; &l14&rAnd inquired not of the LORD\: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David
Book4Page25=to Saul, &l12&rThey arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. &l13&rSo Saul died for his transgression which he
Book7Page49=LORD my God\: &l8&rBut the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars\: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. &l9&rBehold, a son shall be
Book4Page24=Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. &l10&rAnd they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. &l11&rAnd when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done
Book7Page48=David prepared abundantly before his death. &l6&rThen he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel. &l7&rAnd David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the
Book4Page23=&l8&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. &l9&rAnd when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the
Book7Page47=cedar wood to David. &l5&rAnd David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries\: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So
Book4Page22=three sons, and all his house died together. &l7&rAnd when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled\: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
Book7Page46=build the house of God. &l3&rAnd David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; &l4&rAlso cedar trees in abundance\: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much
Book4Page21=uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. &l5&rAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. &l6&rSo Saul died, and his
Book7Page45=Chapter 22\nThen David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. &l2&rAnd David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to
Book4Page20=Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. &l3&rAnd the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers. &l4&rThen said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these
Book7Page44=&l30&rBut David could not go before it to inquire of God\: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
Book7Page43=the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. &l29&rFor the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
Book7Page42=and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. &l27&rAnd the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. &l28&rAt that time when David saw that
Book7Page41=for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. &l25&rSo David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. &l26&rAnd David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings
Book7Page40=which is good in his eyes\: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. &l24&rAnd king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price\:
Book8Page19=vessels of it for the service thereof. &l27&rFor by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above\: &l28&rBecause their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and
Book8Page18=LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. &l25&rFor David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever\: &l26&rAnd also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any
Book6Page9=peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. &l3&rAnd he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. &l4&rAnd he appointed certain of the Levites to
Book8Page17=Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. &l24&rThese were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the
Book6Page8=Chapter 16\nSo they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it\: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. &l2&rAnd when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the
Book8Page16=Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second. &l21&rThe sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. &l22&rAnd Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters\: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them. &l23&rThe sons of
Book6Page7=at a window saw king David dancing and playing\: and she despised him in her heart.
Book6Page6=shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out
Book8Page15=Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. &l18&rOf the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. &l19&rOf the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. &l20&rOf the sons of
Book8Page14=&l14&rNow concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. &l15&rThe sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. &l16&rOf the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. &l17&rAnd the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And
Book6Page5=with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers\: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. &l28&rThus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with
Book6Page4=up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. &l26&rAnd it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. &l27&rAnd David was clothed
Book8Page13=Hebron, and Uzziel, four. &l13&rThe sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses\: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.
Book8Page12=and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. &l11&rAnd Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second\: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house. &l12&rThe sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar,
Book6Page3=Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God\: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. &l25&rSo David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring
Book6Page2=Sheminith to excel. &l22&rAnd Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song\: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful. &l23&rAnd Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. &l24&rAnd Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and
Book8Page11=Shimei. &l8&rThe sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. &l9&rThe sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan. &l10&rAnd the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush,
Book8Page10=porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith. &l6&rAnd David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. &l7&rOf the Gershonites were, Laadan, and
Book6Page1=Chapter 15 Cont.\nAnd Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; &l21&rAnd Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the
Book4Page19=Chapter 10\nNow the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. &l2&rAnd the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and
Book4Page18=Hanan\: these were the sons of Azel.
Book4Page17=Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; &l43&rAnd Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. &l44&rAnd Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Book4Page16=begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. &l40&rAnd the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal\: and Meribbaal begat Micah. &l41&rAnd the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz. &l42&rAnd Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat
Book7Page39=place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD\: thou shalt grant it me for the full price\: that the plague may be stayed from the people. &l23&rAnd Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that
Book4Page15=Baal, and Ner, and Nadab, &l37&rAnd Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. &l38&rAnd Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren. &l39&rAnd Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul
Book7Page38=with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. &l21&rAnd as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. &l22&rThen David said to Ornan, Grant me the
Book4Page14=&l34&rThese chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem. &l35&rAnd in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah\: &l36&rAnd his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and
Book7Page37=that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. &l19&rAnd David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD. &l20&rAnd Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
Book4Page13=brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath. &l33&rAnd these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free\: for they were employed in that work day and night.
Book7Page36=evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. &l18&rThen the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David,
Book4Page12=&l30&rAnd some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. &l31&rAnd Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans. &l32&rAnd other of their
Book7Page35=in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. &l17&rAnd David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done
Book4Page11=vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale. &l29&rSome of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
Book7Page34=that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. &l16&rAnd David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword
Book4Page10=over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. &l27&rAnd they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them. &l28&rAnd certain of them had the charge of the ministering
Book7Page33=man. &l14&rSo the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel\: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. &l15&rAnd God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it\: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel
Book7Page32=Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. &l13&rAnd David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait\: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies\: but let me not fall into the hand of
Book7Page31=famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of
Book7Page30=seer, saying, &l10&rGo and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things\: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. &l11&rSo Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee &l12&rEither three years'
Book7Page29=thing; therefore he smote Israel. &l8&rAnd David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing\: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. &l9&rAnd the LORD spake unto Gad, David's
Book7Page28=an hundred thousand men that drew sword\: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. &l6&rBut Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them\: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. &l7&rAnd God was displeased with this
