Book11Page29=for your health\: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. &l35&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all\: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. &l36&rThen were they all of good
Book11Page28=let her fall off. &l33&rAnd while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. &l34&rWherefore I pray you to take some meat\: for this is
Book11Page27=boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, &l31&rPaul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. &l32&rThen the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and
Book11Page26=sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. &l29&rThen fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. &l30&rAnd as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the
Book11Page25=&l27&rBut when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; &l28&rAnd sounded, and found it twenty fathoms\: and when they had gone a little further, they
Book11Page24=thou must be brought before Caesar\: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. &l25&rWherefore, sirs, be of good cheer\: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me. &l26&rHowbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
Book11Page23=harm and loss. &l22&rAnd now I exhort you to be of good cheer\: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship. &l23&rFor there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, &l24&rSaying, Fear not, Paul;
Book11Page22=small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away. &l21&rBut after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this
Book11Page21=were driven. &l18&rAnd we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; &l19&rAnd the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. &l20&rAnd when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
Book11Page20=&l16&rAnd running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat\: &l17&rWhich when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so
Book11Page19=obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete. &l14&rBut not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. &l15&rAnd when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
Book11Page18=the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. &l13&rAnd when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
Book11Page17=damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. &l11&rNevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. &l12&rAnd because the haven was not commodious to winter in,
Book11Page16=nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. &l9&rNow when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, &l10&rAnd said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much
Book11Page15=put us therein. &l7&rAnd when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; &l8&rAnd, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens;
Book11Page14=from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. &l5&rAnd when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. &l6&rAnd there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he
Book11Page13=coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. &l3&rAnd the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. &l4&rAnd when we had launched
Book11Page12=Chapter 27\nAnd when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. &l2&rAnd entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the
Book11Page11=said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
Book11Page10=&l30&rAnd when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them\: &l31&rAnd when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. &l32&rThen
Book2Page50=great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. &l8&rAnd Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
Book4Page9=&l5&rAnd he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest\: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. &l6&rAnd he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and
Book4Page8=he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd as he journeyed, he came near Damascus\: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven\: &l4&rAnd he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Book4Page7=Chapter 9\nAnd Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, &l2&rAnd desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
Book4Page6=found at Azotus\: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
Book2Page49=and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch\: &l6&rWhom they set before the apostles\: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. &l7&rAnd the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a
Book4Page5=down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. &l39&rAnd when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more\: and he went on his way rejoicing. &l40&rBut Philip was
Book2Page48=&l4&rBut we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. &l5&rAnd the saying pleased the whole multitude\: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon,
Book4Page4=water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? &l37&rAnd Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. &l38&rAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still\: and they went
Book2Page47=disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. &l3&rWherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
Book4Page3=the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? &l35&rThen Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. &l36&rAnd as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water\: and the eunuch said, See, here is
Book2Page46=Chapter 6\nAnd in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. &l2&rThen the twelve called the multitude of the
Book4Page2=before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth\: &l33&rIn his humiliation his judgment was taken away\: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. &l34&rAnd the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh
Book2Page45=every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
Book4Page1=Chapter 8 Cont.\nAnd he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. &l32&rThe place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb
Book2Page44=them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. &l41&rAnd they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. &l42&rAnd daily in the temple, and in
Book2Page43=alone\: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought\: &l39&rBut if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. &l40&rAnd to him they agreed\: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten
Book2Page42=nought. &l37&rAfter this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him\: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. &l38&rAnd now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
Book2Page41=intend to do as touching these men. &l36&rFor before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves\: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to
Book2Page40=stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; &l35&rAnd said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye
Book2Page39=Israel, and forgiveness of sins. &l32&rAnd we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. &l33&rWhen they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. &l34&rThen
Book2Page38=apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. &l30&rThe God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. &l31&rHim hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to
Book2Page37=and the high priest asked them, &l28&rSaying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. &l29&rThen Peter and the other
Book2Page36=the temple, and teaching the people. &l26&rThen went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence\: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. &l27&rAnd when they had brought them, they set them before the council\:
Book2Page35=within. &l24&rNow when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. &l25&rThen came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in
Book2Page34=brought. &l22&rBut when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, &l23&rSaying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors\: but when we had opened, we found no man
Book2Page33=they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them
Book2Page32=hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. &l19&rBut the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, &l20&rGo, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. &l21&rAnd when
Book2Page31=sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits\: and they were healed every one. &l17&rThen the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation, &l18&rAnd laid their
Book2Page30=that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. &l16&rThere came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing
Book2Page29=people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. &l13&rAnd of the rest durst no man join himself to them\: but the people magnified them. &l14&rAnd believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) &l15&rInsomuch
Book2Page28=came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. &l11&rAnd great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things. &l12&rAnd by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the
Book2Page27=it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out. &l10&rThen fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost\: and the young men
Book2Page26=&l7&rAnd it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. &l8&rAnd Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. &l9&rThen Peter said unto her, How is
Book2Page25=thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. &l5&rAnd Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost\: and great fear came on all them that heard these things. &l6&rAnd the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.
Book2Page24=hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? &l4&rWhiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
Book2Page23=Chapter 5\nBut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, &l2&rAnd kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. &l3&rBut Peter said, Ananias, why
Book2Page22=apostles' feet.
Book2Page21=according as he had need. &l36&rAnd Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, &l37&rHaving land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the
Book2Page20=&l34&rNeither was there any among them that lacked\: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, &l35&rAnd laid them down at the apostles' feet\: and distribution was made unto every man
Book2Page19=soul\: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. &l33&rAnd with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus\: and great grace was upon them all.
Book2Page18=&l31&rAnd when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. &l32&rAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
Book2Page17=&l29&rAnd now, Lord, behold their threatenings\: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, &l30&rBy stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
Book2Page16=of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, &l28&rFor to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
Book2Page15=them is\: &l25&rWho by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? &l26&rThe kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. &l27&rFor
Book2Page14=company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. &l24&rAnd when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in
Book2Page13=finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people\: for all men glorified God for that which was done. &l22&rFor the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. &l23&rAnd being let go, they went to their own
Book2Page12=answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. &l20&rFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. &l21&rSo when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
Book2Page11=that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. &l18&rAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. &l19&rBut Peter and John
Book2Page10=them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, &l16&rSaying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. &l17&rBut
Book5Page9=&l10&rAnd this was done three times\: and all were drawn up again into heaven. &l11&rAnd, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. &l12&rAnd the spirit bade me go with them, nothing
Book5Page8=a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. &l8&rBut I said, Not so, Lord\: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. &l9&rBut the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.
Book5Page7=great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me\: &l6&rUpon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. &l7&rAnd I heard
Book5Page6=uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. &l4&rBut Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying, &l5&rI was in the city of Joppa praying\: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a
Book5Page5=Chapter 11\nAnd the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. &l2&rAnd when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, &l3&rSaying, Thou wentest in to men
Book5Page4=commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
Book5Page3=poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. &l46&rFor they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, &l47&rCan any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? &l48&rAnd he
Book5Page2=receive remission of sins. &l44&rWhile Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. &l45&rAnd they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was
Book5Page1=Chapter 10 Cont.\nAnd he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. &l43&rTo him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall
Book6Page50=and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Book6Page49=was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other\: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; &l40&rAnd Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. &l41&rAnd he went through Syria
Book6Page48=and see how they do. &l37&rAnd Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. &l38&rBut Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. &l39&rAnd the contention
Book6Page47=also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. &l36&rAnd some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord,
Book6Page46=themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. &l33&rAnd after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. &l34&rNotwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. &l35&rPaul
Book6Page45=&l30&rSo when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch\: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle\: &l31&rWhich when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. &l32&rAnd Judas and Silas, being prophets also
Book6Page44=and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; &l29&rThat ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication\: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
Book6Page43=with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, &l26&rMen that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &l27&rWe have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. &l28&rFor it seemed good to the Holy Ghost,
Book6Page42=which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law\: to whom we gave no such commandment\: &l25&rIt seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you
Book6Page41=men among the brethren\: &l23&rAnd they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia\: &l24&rForasmuch as we have heard, that certain
Book6Page40=preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. &l22&rThen pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief
Book6Page39=them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God\: &l20&rBut that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. &l21&rFor Moses of old time hath in every city them that
Book6Page38=of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. &l18&rKnown unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. &l19&rWherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not
Book6Page37=&l15&rAnd to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, &l16&rAfter this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up\: &l17&rThat the residue
Book6Page36=wrought among the Gentiles by them. &l13&rAnd after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me\: &l14&rSimeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
Book6Page35=nor we were able to bear? &l11&rBut we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. &l12&rThen all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
Book6Page34=them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; &l9&rAnd put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. &l10&rNow therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers
Book6Page33=much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. &l8&rAnd God, which knoweth the hearts, bare
Book6Page32=certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. &l6&rAnd the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. &l7&rAnd when there had been
Book6Page31=of the Gentiles\: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. &l4&rAnd when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. &l5&rBut there rose up
Book6Page30=determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. &l3&rAnd being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion
Book6Page29=Chapter 15\nAnd certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. &l2&rWhen therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they
Book6Page28=faith unto the Gentiles. &l28&rAnd there they abode long time with the disciples.
Book6Page27=Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. &l27&rAnd when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of
Book6Page26=fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. &l24&rAnd after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. &l25&rAnd when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia\: &l26&rAnd thence sailed to
Book6Page25=Antioch, &l22&rConfirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. &l23&rAnd when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with
Book6Page24=disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city\: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. &l21&rAnd when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and
Book6Page23=they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. &l19&rAnd there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. &l20&rHowbeit, as the
Book6Page22=nations to walk in their own ways. &l17&rNevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. &l18&rAnd with these sayings scarce restrained
Book6Page21=these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein\: &l16&rWho in times past suffered all
Book6Page20=city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. &l14&rWhich when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, &l15&rAnd saying, Sirs, why do ye
Book10Page50=as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, &l13&rAt midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
Book6Page9=they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. &l46&rThen Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you\: but seeing
Book6Page8=religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas\: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. &l44&rAnd the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. &l45&rBut when the Jews saw the multitudes,
Book6Page7=believe, though a man declare it unto you. &l42&rAnd when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath. &l43&rNow when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
Book6Page6=ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. &l40&rBeware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; &l41&rBehold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish\: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise
Book6Page5=&l37&rBut he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. &l38&rBe it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins\: &l39&rAnd by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which
Book6Page4=&l35&rWherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. &l36&rFor David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption\:
Book6Page3=also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. &l34&rAnd as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
Book6Page2=Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. &l32&rAnd we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, &l33&rGod hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is
Book6Page1=Chapter 13 Cont.\nAnd when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. &l30&rBut God raised him from the dead\: &l31&rAnd he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to
Book6Page19=their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. &l12&rAnd they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. &l13&rThen the priest of Jupiter, which was before their
Book6Page18=&l9&rThe same heard Paul speak\: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, &l10&rSaid with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. &l11&rAnd when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
Book6Page17=unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about\: &l7&rAnd there they preached the gospel. &l8&rAnd there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked\:
Book6Page16=was divided\: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. &l5&rAnd when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, &l6&rThey were ware of it, and fled
Book6Page15=their minds evil affected against the brethren. &l3&rLong time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. &l4&rBut the multitude of the city
Book6Page14=Chapter 14\nAnd it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. &l2&rBut the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
Book6Page13=disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
Book10Page49=priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. &l11&rAnd I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. &l12&rWhereupon
Book6Page12=the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts. &l51&rBut they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. &l52&rAnd the
Book10Page48=raise the dead? &l9&rI verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. &l10&rWhich thing I also did in Jerusalem\: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
Book6Page11=earth. &l48&rAnd when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord\: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. &l49&rAnd the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region. &l50&rBut the Jews stirred up
Book10Page47=of God unto our fathers\: &l7&rUnto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. &l8&rWhy should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should
Book6Page10=ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. &l47&rFor so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the
Book10Page46=among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; &l5&rWhich knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. &l6&rAnd now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
Book10Page45=things whereof I am accused of the Jews\: &l3&rEspecially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews\: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. &l4&rMy manner of life from my youth, which was at the first
Book10Page44=Chapter 26\nThen Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself\: &l2&rI think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the
Book10Page43=specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. &l27&rFor it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.
Book10Page42=when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. &l26&rOf whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and
Book10Page41=forth. &l24&rAnd Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. &l25&rBut
Book10Page40=morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. &l23&rAnd on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought
Book10Page39=and there be judged of these matters. &l21&rBut when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. &l22&rThen Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To
Book10Page38=as I supposed\: &l19&rBut had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. &l20&rAnd because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem,
Book10Page37=laid against him. &l17&rTherefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. &l18&rAgainst whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things
Book10Page36=me, desiring to have judgment against him. &l16&rTo whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime
Book10Page35=salute Festus. &l14&rAnd when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix\: &l15&rAbout whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed
Book10Page34=may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar. &l12&rThen Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. &l13&rAnd after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to
Book10Page33=where I ought to be judged\: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. &l11&rFor if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die\: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man
Book10Page32=Caesar, have I offended any thing at all. &l9&rBut Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? &l10&rThen said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat,
Book10Page31=Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. &l8&rWhile he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against
Book10Page30=me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him. &l6&rAnd when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought. &l7&rAnd when he was come, the
Book10Page29=would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him. &l4&rBut Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither. &l5&rLet them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with
Book10Page28=Chapter 25\nNow when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. &l2&rThen the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, &l3&rAnd desired favour against him, that he
Book10Page27=after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room\: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
Book10Page26=answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. &l26&rHe hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him\: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. &l27&rBut
Book10Page25=him. &l24&rAnd after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. &l25&rAnd as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and
Book10Page24=and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. &l23&rAnd he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto
Book10Page23=&l21&rExcept it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day. &l22&rAnd when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them,
Book10Page22=temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. &l19&rWho ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. &l20&rOr else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
Book10Page21=&l16&rAnd herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men. &l17&rNow after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. &l18&rWhereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
Book10Page20=so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets\: &l15&rAnd have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
Book10Page19=the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city\: &l13&rNeither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. &l14&rBut this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy,
Book10Page18=thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself\: &l11&rBecause that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. &l12&rAnd they neither found me in
Book10Page17=whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. &l9&rAnd the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so. &l10&rThen Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that
Book10Page16=about to profane the temple\: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. &l7&rBut the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, &l8&rCommanding his accusers to come unto thee\: by examining of
Book10Page15=pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. &l5&rFor we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes\: &l6&rWho also hath gone
Book10Page14=thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, &l3&rWe accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. &l4&rNotwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
Book10Page13=Chapter 24\nAnd after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. &l2&rAnd when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by
Book10Page12=letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; &l35&rI will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
Book10Page11=Antipatris. &l32&rOn the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle\: &l33&rWho, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. &l34&rAnd when the governor had read the
Book10Page10=how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell. &l31&rThen the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to
Book7Page9=faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying\:
Book7Page8=of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us\: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. &l15&rAnd when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be
Book7Page7=that city abiding certain days. &l13&rAnd on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. &l14&rAnd a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple,
Book7Page6=preach the gospel unto them. &l11&rTherefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; &l12&rAnd from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony\: and we were in
Book7Page5=in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. &l10&rAnd after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to
Book7Page4=and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, &l7&rAfter they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia\: but the Spirit suffered them not. &l8&rAnd they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. &l9&rAnd a vision appeared to Paul
Book7Page3=the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. &l5&rAnd so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. &l6&rNow when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
Book7Page2=Lystra and Iconium. &l3&rHim would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters\: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. &l4&rAnd as they went through the cities, they delivered them
Book7Page1=Chapter 16\nThen came he to Derbe and Lystra\: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek\: &l2&rWhich was well reported of by the brethren that were at
Book1Page50=your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. &l23&rAnd it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
Book1Page49=the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. &l22&rFor Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of
Book1Page48=hath so fulfilled. &l19&rRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; &l20&rAnd he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you\: &l21&rWhom
Book1Page47=this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. &l17&rAnd now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. &l18&rBut those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he
Book1Page46=granted unto you; &l15&rAnd killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. &l16&rAnd his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know\: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him
Book1Page45=Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. &l14&rBut ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be
Book1Page44=greatly wondering. &l12&rAnd when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? &l13&rThe God of Abraham, and of
Book1Page43=Beautiful gate of the temple\: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him. &l11&rAnd as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's,
Book1Page42=strength. &l8&rAnd he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. &l9&rAnd all the people saw him walking and praising God\: &l10&rAnd they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
Book1Page41=them. &l6&rThen Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee\: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. &l7&rAnd he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up\: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received
Book1Page40=of them that entered into the temple; &l3&rWho seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. &l4&rAnd Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. &l5&rAnd he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
Book1Page39=Chapter 3\nNow Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. &l2&rAnd a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms
Book1Page38=singleness of heart, &l47&rPraising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
Book1Page37=things common; &l45&rAnd sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. &l46&rAnd they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
Book1Page36=continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. &l43&rAnd fear came upon every soul\: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. &l44&rAnd all that believed were together, and had all
Book1Page35=with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. &l41&rThen they that gladly received his word were baptized\: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. &l42&rAnd they
Book1Page34=of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &l39&rFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &l40&rAnd
Book1Page33=crucified, both Lord and Christ. &l37&rNow when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? &l38&rThen Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
Book1Page32=ascended into the heavens\: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, &l35&rUntil I make thy foes thy footstool. &l36&rTherefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have
Book1Page31=Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. &l33&rTherefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. &l34&rFor David is not
Book1Page30=that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; &l31&rHe seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. &l32&rThis
Book1Page29=thy countenance. &l29&rMen and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. &l30&rTherefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him,
Book1Page28=tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope\: &l27&rBecause thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. &l28&rThou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with
Book1Page27=death\: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. &l25&rFor David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved\: &l26&rTherefore did my heart rejoice, and my
Book1Page26=by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know\: &l23&rHim, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain\: &l24&rWhom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of
Book1Page25=the Lord come\: &l21&rAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. &l22&rYe men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did
Book1Page24=Spirit; and they shall prophesy\: &l19&rAnd I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke\: &l20&rThe sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of
Book1Page23=God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh\: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams\: &l18&rAnd on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my
Book1Page22=this known unto you, and hearken to my words\: &l15&rFor these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. &l16&rBut this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; &l17&rAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, saith
Book1Page21=in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? &l13&rOthers mocking said, These men are full of new wine. &l14&rBut Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be
Book1Page20=&l10&rPhrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, &l11&rCretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. &l12&rAnd they were all amazed, and were
Book8Page9=him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. &l3&rAnd he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. &l4&rThen said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the
Book8Page8=Chapter 19\nAnd it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus\: and finding certain disciples, &l2&rHe said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto
Book8Page7=grace\: &l28&rFor he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
Book8Page6=took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. &l27&rAnd when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him\: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through
Book8Page5=instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. &l26&rAnd he began to speak boldly in the synagogue\: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they
Book8Page4=departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. &l24&rAnd a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. &l25&rThis man was
Book8Page3=that cometh in Jerusalem\: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. &l22&rAnd when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. &l23&rAnd after he had spent some time there, he
Book8Page2=Ephesus, and left them there\: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. &l20&rWhen they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; &l21&rBut bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast
Book8Page1=Chapter 18 Cont.\nAnd Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea\: for he had a vow. &l19&rAnd he came to
Book1Page19=Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? &l8&rAnd how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? &l9&rParthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
Book1Page18=out of every nation under heaven. &l6&rNow when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. &l7&rAnd they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
Book1Page17=unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. &l4&rAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. &l5&rAnd there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
Book1Page16=Chapter 2\nAnd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. &l2&rAnd suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. &l3&rAnd there appeared
Book1Page15=which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. &l26&rAnd they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
Book1Page14=Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. &l24&rAnd they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, &l25&rThat he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from
Book1Page13=with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, &l22&rBeginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. &l23&rAnd they appointed two,
Book1Page12=proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. &l20&rFor it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein\: and his bishoprick let another take. &l21&rWherefore of these men which have companied
Book1Page11=&l18&rNow this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. &l19&rAnd it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their
Book1Page10=brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. &l17&rFor he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
Book9Page50=bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
Book9Page49=together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. &l13&rAnd they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. &l14&rAnd they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
Book9Page48=him into the castle. &l11&rAnd the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul\: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome. &l12&rAnd when it was day, certain of the Jews banded
Book9Page47=to him, let us not fight against God. &l10&rAnd when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring
Book9Page46=no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit\: but the Pharisees confess both. &l9&rAnd there arose a great cry\: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man\: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken
Book9Page45=the son of a Pharisee\: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. &l7&rAnd when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees\: and the multitude was divided. &l8&rFor the Sadducees say that there is
Book9Page44=that he was the high priest\: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. &l6&rBut when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee,
Book9Page43=unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall\: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? &l4&rAnd they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? &l5&rThen said Paul, I wist not, brethren,
Book9Page42=Chapter 23\nAnd Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day. &l2&rAnd the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. &l3&rThen said Paul
Book9Page41=commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
Book9Page40=examined him\: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. &l30&rOn the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and
Book5Page50=prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. &l28&rAnd though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
Book9Page39=captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. &l28&rAnd the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born. &l29&rThen straightway they departed from him which should have
Book9Page38=centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? &l26&rWhen the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest\: for this man is a Roman. &l27&rThen the chief
Book9Page37=into the air, &l24&rThe chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. &l25&rAnd as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
Book9Page36=Gentiles. &l22&rAnd they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth\: for it is not fit that he should live. &l23&rAnd as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust
Book9Page35=believed on thee\: &l20&rAnd when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. &l21&rAnd he said unto me, Depart\: for I will send thee far hence unto the
Book9Page34=I was in a trance; &l18&rAnd saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem\: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. &l19&rAnd I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that
Book9Page33=men of what thou hast seen and heard. &l16&rAnd now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple,
Book9Page32=thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. &l14&rAnd he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. &l15&rFor thou shalt be his witness unto all
Book9Page31=being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. &l12&rAnd one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, &l13&rCame unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive
Book9Page30=spake to me. &l10&rAnd I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. &l11&rAnd when I could not see for the glory of that light,
Book5Page49=loose. &l26&rMen and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. &l27&rFor they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the
Book5Page48=preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. &l25&rAnd as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to
Book5Page47=also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. &l23&rOf this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus\: &l24&rWhen John had first
Book5Page46=Samuel the prophet. &l21&rAnd afterward they desired a king\: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. &l22&rAnd when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom
Book5Page45=suffered he their manners in the wilderness. &l19&rAnd when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. &l20&rAnd after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until
Book5Page44=that fear God, give audience. &l17&rThe God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. &l18&rAnd about the time of forty years
Book5Page43=the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. &l16&rThen Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye
Book5Page42=loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia\: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. &l14&rBut when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down. &l15&rAnd after
Book5Page41=immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. &l12&rThen the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. &l13&rNow when Paul and his company
Book5Page40=and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? &l11&rAnd now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
Book9Page29=Saul, why persecutest thou me? &l8&rAnd I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. &l9&rAnd they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that
Book9Page28=for to be punished. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. &l7&rAnd I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul,
Book9Page27=delivering into prisons both men and women. &l5&rAs also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders\: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem,
Book9Page26=city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. &l4&rAnd I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and
Book9Page25=Chapter 22\nMen, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. &l2&r(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence\: and he saith,) &l3&rI am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a
Book9Page24=unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
Book9Page23=&l39&rBut Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city\: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people. &l40&rAnd when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand
Book9Page22=the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? &l38&rArt not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
Book9Page9=our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem. &l16&rThere went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. &l17&rAnd when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren
Book9Page21=carried into the castle. &l35&rAnd when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. &l36&rFor the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him. &l37&rAnd as Paul was to be led into
Book9Page8=weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. &l14&rAnd when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. &l15&rAnd after those days we took up
Book9Page20=and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. &l34&rAnd some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude\: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be
Book5Page39=Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. &l9&rThen Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him, &l10&rAnd said, O full of all subtilty
Book9Page7=Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. &l12&rAnd when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. &l13&rThen Paul answered, What mean ye to
Book5Page38=unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus\: &l7&rWhich was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. &l8&rBut
Book9Page6=&l10&rAnd as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. &l11&rAnd when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at
Book5Page37=Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. &l5&rAnd when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews\: and they had also John to their minister. &l6&rAnd when they had gone through the isle
Book9Page5=the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea\: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. &l9&rAnd the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
Book5Page36=to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. &l3&rAnd when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. &l4&rSo they, being sent forth by the Holy
Book9Page4=shore, and prayed. &l6&rAnd when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again. &l7&rAnd when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. &l8&rAnd
Book5Page35=Chapter 13\nNow there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. &l2&rAs they ministered
Book9Page3=through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. &l5&rAnd when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city\: and we kneeled down on the
Book5Page34=when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
Book9Page2=aboard, and set forth. &l3&rNow when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre\: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. &l4&rAnd finding disciples, we tarried there seven days\: who said to Paul
Book5Page33=not of a man. &l23&rAnd immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory\: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. &l24&rBut the word of God grew and multiplied. &l25&rAnd Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem,
Book9Page1=Chapter 21\nAnd it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara\: &l2&rAnd finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went
Book5Page32=desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. &l21&rAnd upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. &l22&rAnd the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and
Book5Page31=should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode. &l20&rAnd Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon\: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend,
Book5Page30=departed, and went into another place. &l18&rNow as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. &l19&rAnd when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they
Book9Page19=captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. &l32&rWho immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them\: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. &l33&rThen the chief captain came near,
Book9Page18=Paul had brought into the temple.) &l30&rAnd all the city was moved, and the people ran together\: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple\: and forthwith the doors were shut. &l31&rAnd as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
Book9Page17=all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place\: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place. &l29&r(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that
Book9Page16=for every one of them. &l27&rAnd when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, &l28&rCrying out, Men of Israel, help\: This is the man, that teacheth
Ch28=B12P3
Book9Page15=from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. &l26&rThen Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered
Ch27=B11P34
Book9Page14=nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. &l25&rAs touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and
Ch26=B11P11
Book9Page13=that we say to thee\: We have four men which have a vow on them; &l24&rThem take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads\: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are
Ch25=B10P43
Book9Page12=the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. &l22&rWhat is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together\: for they will hear that thou art come. &l23&rDo therefore this
Ch24=B10P27
Book9Page11=they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law\: &l21&rAnd they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among
Ch23=B10P12
Book9Page10=received us gladly. &l18&rAnd the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. &l19&rAnd when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. &l20&rAnd when
Book5Page29=door, and saw him, they were astonished. &l17&rBut he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he
Ch22=B9P41
Book5Page28=gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate. &l15&rAnd they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. &l16&rBut Peter continued knocking\: and when they had opened the
Ch21=B9P24
Book5Page27=Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. &l13&rAnd as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. &l14&rAnd when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
Ch20=B8P50
Book5Page26=come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. &l12&rAnd when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
Book5Page25=past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord\: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. &l11&rAnd when Peter was
Book5Page24=and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. &l9&rAnd he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. &l10&rWhen they were
Book5Page23=&l7&rAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison\: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. &l8&rAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself,
Book5Page22=but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. &l6&rAnd when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains\: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
Book5Page21=were the days of unleavened bread.) &l4&rAnd when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. &l5&rPeter therefore was kept in prison\:
Book5Page20=Chapter 12\nNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. &l2&rAnd he killed James the brother of John with the sword. &l3&rAnd because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then

Ch16=B7P21
Ch15=B6P50
Ch14=B6P28
Ch13=B6P13
Book5Page19=every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea\: &l30&rWhich also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
Ch12=B5P34
Book5Page18=prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. &l28&rAnd there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world\: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. &l29&rThen the disciples,
Book10Page9=would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council\: &l29&rWhom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. &l30&rAnd when it was told me
Ch11=B5P19
Book5Page17=&l26&rAnd when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. &l27&rAnd in these days came
Book10Page8=&l26&rClaudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting. &l27&rThis man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them\: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman. &l28&rAnd when I
Ch10=B5P4
Book5Page16=exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. &l24&rFor he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith\: and much people was added unto the Lord. &l25&rThen departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul\:
Book10Page7=Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; &l24&rAnd provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor. &l25&rAnd he wrote a letter after this manner\:
Book5Page15=and turned unto the Lord. &l22&rThen tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem\: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. &l23&rWho, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
Book10Page6=promise from thee. &l22&rSo the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. &l23&rAnd he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to
Book5Page14=word to none but unto the Jews only. &l20&rAnd some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus. &l21&rAnd the hand of the Lord was with them\: and a great number believed,
Book10Page5=perfectly. &l21&rBut do not thou yield unto them\: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him\: and now are they ready, looking for a
Book5Page13=peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. &l19&rNow they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the
Book10Page4=went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me? &l20&rAnd he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more
Book5Page12=water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. &l17&rForasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? &l18&rWhen they heard these things, they held their
Book10Page3=him. &l18&rSo he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee. &l19&rThen the chief captain took him by the hand, and
Book5Page11=&l14&rWho shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved. &l15&rAnd as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. &l16&rThen remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with
Book10Page2=when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. &l17&rThen Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain\: for he hath a certain thing to tell
Book5Page10=doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house\: &l13&rAnd he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
Book10Page1=Chapter 23 Cont.\nNow therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him\: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him. &l16&rAnd
Book4Page50=openly; &l41&rNot to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
Book4Page49=all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. &l39&rAnd we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree\: &l40&rHim God raised up the third day, and shewed him
Book4Page48=&l37&rThat word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; &l38&rHow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power\: who went about doing good, and healing
Book4Page47=that God is no respecter of persons\: &l35&rBut in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. &l36&rThe word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ\: (he is Lord of all\:)
Book4Page46=&l33&rImmediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. &l34&rThen Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
Book4Page45=is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. &l32&rSend therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side\: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
Book4Page44=therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? &l30&rAnd Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, &l31&rAnd said, Cornelius, thy prayer
Book11Page9=thou believest. &l28&rThen Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. &l29&rAnd Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
Book4Page43=is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. &l29&rTherefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for\: I ask
Book11Page8=soberness. &l26&rFor the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely\: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. &l27&rKing Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that
Book4Page42=him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. &l26&rBut Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. &l27&rAnd as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. &l28&rAnd he said unto them, Ye know how that it
Book11Page7=people, and to the Gentiles. &l24&rAnd as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. &l25&rBut he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and
Book4Page41=away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him. &l24&rAnd the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends. &l25&rAnd as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met
Book11Page6=witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come\: &l23&rThat Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the
Book4Page40=man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee. &l23&rThen called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went
Book11Page5=and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. &l21&rFor these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. &l22&rHaving therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
Book11Page4=inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. &l19&rWhereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision\: &l20&rBut shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea,
Book11Page3=unto thee; &l17&rDelivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, &l18&rTo open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
Book11Page2=said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. &l16&rBut rise, and stand upon thy feet\: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear
Book11Page1=Chapter 26 Cont.\nAnd when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. &l15&rAnd I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he
Book4Page39=doubting nothing\: for I have sent them. &l21&rThen Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek\: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? &l22&rAnd they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just
Book4Page38=gate, &l18&rAnd called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. &l19&rWhile Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. &l20&rArise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them,
Book4Page37=done thrice\: and the vessel was received up again into heaven. &l17&rNow while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the
Book4Page36=to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. &l14&rBut Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. &l15&rAnd the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. &l16&rThis was
Book4Page35=descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth\: &l12&rWherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. &l13&rAnd there came a voice
Book4Page34=journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour\: &l10&rAnd he became very hungry, and would have eaten\: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance, &l11&rAnd saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel
Book4Page33=unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; &l8&rAnd when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa. &l9&rOn the morrow, as they went on their
Book4Page32=memorial before God. &l5&rAnd now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter\: &l6&rHe lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side\: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. &l7&rAnd when the angel which spake
Book4Page31=vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. &l4&rAnd when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a
Book4Page30=Chapter 10\nThere was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, &l2&rA devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. &l3&rHe saw in a
Book4Page29=throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. &l43&rAnd it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
Book4Page28=and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes\: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. &l41&rAnd he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive. &l42&rAnd it was known
Book4Page27=with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber\: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. &l40&rBut Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
Book4Page26=washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. &l38&rAnd forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. &l39&rThen Peter arose and went
Book4Page25=&l36&rNow there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas\: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. &l37&rAnd it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died\: whom when they had
Book4Page24=his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. &l34&rAnd Peter said unto him, AEneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole\: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. &l35&rAnd all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
Book4Page23=the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. &l32&rAnd it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. &l33&rAnd there he found a certain man named AEneas, which had kept
Book4Page22=they went about to slay him. &l30&rWhich when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. &l31&rThen had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of
Book4Page21=that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. &l28&rAnd he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. &l29&rAnd he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians\: but
Book4Page20=Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples\: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. &l27&rBut Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and
Book4Page19=Jews took counsel to kill him\: &l24&rBut their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. &l25&rThen the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket. &l26&rAnd when Saul was come to
Book4Page18=for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? &l22&rBut Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. &l23&rAnd after that many days were fulfilled, the
Book4Page17=which were at Damascus. &l20&rAnd straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. &l21&rBut all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither
Book4Page16=with the Holy Ghost. &l18&rAnd immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales\: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. &l19&rAnd when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples
Book4Page15=sake. &l17&rAnd Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled
Book4Page14=all that call on thy name. &l15&rBut the Lord said unto him, Go thy way\: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel\: &l16&rFor I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's
Book4Page13=in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. &l13&rThen Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem\: &l14&rAnd here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind
Book4Page12=I am here, Lord. &l11&rAnd the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus\: for, behold, he prayeth, &l12&rAnd hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming
Book4Page11=him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. &l9&rAnd he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. &l10&rAnd there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold,
Book4Page10=go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. &l7&rAnd the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. &l8&rAnd Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man\: but they led
Book12Page3=in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, &l31&rPreaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
Book12Page2=&l28&rBe it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. &l29&rAnd when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. &l30&rAnd Paul dwelt two whole years
Book12Page1=Chapter 28 Cont.\nFor the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
Book8Page50=should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
Book8Page49=more blessed to give than to receive. &l36&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. &l37&rAnd they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, &l38&rSorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
Book8Page48=yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. &l35&rI have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is
Book8Page47=&l32&rAnd now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. &l33&rI have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. &l34&rYea, ye
Book8Page46=sparing the flock. &l30&rAlso of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. &l31&rTherefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
Book8Page45=yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. &l29&rFor I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not
Book8Page44=gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. &l26&rWherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. &l27&rFor I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. &l28&rTake heed therefore unto
Book8Page43=move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. &l25&rAnd now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have
Book8Page42=Christ. &l22&rAnd now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there\: &l23&rSave that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. &l24&rBut none of these things
Book8Page41=&l20&rAnd how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, &l21&rTestifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
Book8Page40=unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, &l19&rServing the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews\:
Book8Page39=because he would not spend the time in Asia\: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. &l17&rAnd from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. &l18&rAnd when they were come to him, he said
Book8Page38=him in, and came to Mitylene. &l15&rAnd we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus. &l16&rFor Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus,
Book8Page37=brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted. &l13&rAnd we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul\: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. &l14&rAnd when he met with us at Assos, we took
Book8Page36=down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. &l11&rWhen he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. &l12&rAnd they
Book8Page35=gathered together. &l9&rAnd there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep\: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. &l10&rAnd Paul went
Book8Page34=&l7&rAnd upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. &l8&rAnd there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
Book8Page33=of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. &l5&rThese going before tarried for us at Troas. &l6&rAnd we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
Book8Page32=abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. &l4&rAnd there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius
Book8Page31=Chapter 20\nAnd after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. &l2&rAnd when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, &l3&rAnd there
Book8Page30=the assembly.
Book8Page29=other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. &l40&rFor we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse. &l41&rAnd when he had thus spoken, he dismissed
Book8Page28=nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. &l38&rWherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies\: let them implead one another. &l39&rBut if ye inquire any thing concerning
Book8Page27=goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter? &l36&rSeeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. &l37&rFor ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches,
Book8Page26=about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. &l35&rAnd when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great
Book8Page25=were come together. &l33&rAnd they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. &l34&rBut when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice
Book8Page24=the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. &l32&rSome therefore cried one thing, and some another\: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they
Book8Page23=confusion\: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre. &l30&rAnd when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not. &l31&rAnd certain of
Book8Page22=despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. &l28&rAnd when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. &l29&rAnd the whole city was filled with
Book8Page21=Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands\: &l27&rSo that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be
Book8Page20=brought no small gain unto the craftsmen; &l25&rWhom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. &l26&rMoreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all
Book1Page9=prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. &l15&rAnd in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) &l16&rMen and
Book1Page8=went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. &l14&rThese all continued with one accord in
Book1Page7=is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. &l12&rThen returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. &l13&rAnd when they were come in, they
Book1Page6=cloud received him out of their sight. &l10&rAnd while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; &l11&rWhich also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which
Book1Page5=that the Holy Ghost is come upon you\: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. &l9&rAnd when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a
Book1Page4=they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? &l7&rAnd he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. &l8&rBut ye shall receive power, after
Book1Page3=depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. &l5&rFor John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. &l6&rWhen they therefore were come together,
Book1Page2=whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God\: &l4&rAnd, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not
Book1Page1=Chapter 1\nThe former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, &l2&rUntil the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen\: &l3&rTo
Book8Page19=them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. &l23&rAnd the same time there arose no small stir about that way. &l24&rFor a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana,
Book8Page18=word of God and prevailed. &l21&rAfter these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. &l22&rSo he sent into Macedonia two of
Book8Page17=confessed, and shewed their deeds. &l19&rMany of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men\: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. &l20&rSo mightily grew the
Book8Page16=them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. &l17&rAnd this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. &l18&rAnd many that believed came, and
Book8Page15=one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. &l15&rAnd the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? &l16&rAnd the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against
Book8Page14=evil spirits went out of them. &l13&rThen certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. &l14&rAnd there were seven sons of
Book8Page13=dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. &l11&rAnd God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul\: &l12&rSo that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the
Book8Page12=were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. &l10&rAnd this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which
Book8Page11=they spake with tongues, and prophesied. &l7&rAnd all the men were about twelve. &l8&rAnd he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. &l9&rBut when divers
Book8Page10=people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. &l5&rWhen they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. &l6&rAnd when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and
Book7Page50=Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
Book2Page9=that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. &l14&rAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. &l15&rBut when they had commanded
Book2Page8=you builders, which is become the head of the corner. &l12&rNeither is there salvation in any other\: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. &l13&rNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
Book2Page7=known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. &l11&rThis is the stone which was set at nought of
Book2Page6=name, have ye done this? &l8&rThen Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, &l9&rIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; &l10&rBe it
Book2Page5=scribes, &l6&rAnd Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. &l7&rAnd when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what
Book2Page4=on them, and put them in hold unto the next day\: for it was now eventide. &l4&rHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. &l5&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and
Book2Page3=Chapter 4\nAnd as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, &l2&rBeing grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. &l3&rAnd they laid hands
Book7Page49=Jews, reason would that I should bear with you\: &l15&rBut if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. &l16&rAnd he drave them from the judgment seat. &l17&rThen all the Greeks took
Book2Page2=Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. &l26&rUnto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
Book7Page48=Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, &l13&rSaying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. &l14&rAnd when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye
Book2Page1=Chapter 3 Cont.\nYea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. &l25&rYe are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto
Book7Page47=shall set on thee to hurt thee\: for I have much people in this city. &l11&rAnd he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. &l12&rAnd when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against
Book7Page46=believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. &l9&rThen spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace\: &l10&rFor I am with thee, and no man
Book7Page45=am clean\: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. &l7&rAnd he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. &l8&rAnd Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue,
Book7Page44=and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. &l6&rAnd when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I
Book7Page43=and came unto them. &l3&rAnd because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought\: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. &l4&rAnd he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. &l5&rAnd when Silas
Book7Page42=Chapter 18\nAfter these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; &l2&rAnd found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome\:)
Book7Page41=and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
Book7Page40=they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked\: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. &l33&rSo Paul departed from among them. &l34&rHowbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed\: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite,
Book3Page50=chariot. &l30&rAnd Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
Book7Page39=every where to repent\: &l31&rBecause he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. &l32&rAnd when
Ch9=B4P29
Book7Page38=offspring. &l29&rForasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. &l30&rAnd the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men
Ch8=B4P6
Book7Page37=&l27&rThat they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us\: &l28&rFor in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
Ch7=B3P35
Book7Page36=needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; &l26&rAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
Ch6=B3P4
Book7Page35=therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. &l24&rGod that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; &l25&rNeither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he
Ch5=B2P45
Book7Page34=&l22&rThen Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. &l23&rFor as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom
Ch4=B2P22
Book7Page33=&l20&rFor thou bringest certain strange things to our ears\: we would know therefore what these things mean. &l21&r(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
Ch3=B2P2
Book7Page32=other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods\: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. &l19&rAnd they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
Ch2=B1P38
Book7Page31=disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. &l18&rThen certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say?
Ch1=B1P15
Book7Page30=Athens\: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed. &l16&rNow while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. &l17&rTherefore
Book3Page49=queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, &l28&rWas returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. &l29&rThen the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this
Book3Page48=angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. &l27&rAnd he arose and went\: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace
Book3Page47=to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. &l25&rAnd they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. &l26&rAnd the
Book3Page46=&l22&rRepent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. &l23&rFor I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. &l24&rThen answered Simon, and said, Pray ye
Book3Page45=Holy Ghost. &l20&rBut Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. &l21&rThou hast neither part nor lot in this matter\: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
Book3Page44=on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. &l18&rAnd when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, &l19&rSaying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the
Book3Page43=them Peter and John\: &l15&rWho, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost\: &l16&r(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them\: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) &l17&rThen laid they their hands
Book3Page42=himself believed also\: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. &l14&rNow when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto
Book3Page41=had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. &l12&rBut when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. &l13&rThen Simon
Book3Page40=beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one\: &l10&rTo whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. &l11&rAnd to him they
Book7Page29=preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. &l14&rAnd then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea\: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. &l15&rAnd they that conducted Paul brought him unto
Book7Page28=mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. &l12&rTherefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. &l13&rBut when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was
Book7Page27=them go. &l10&rAnd the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea\: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. &l11&rThese were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of
Book7Page26=all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. &l8&rAnd they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. &l9&rAnd when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let
Book7Page25=sought to bring them out to the people. &l6&rAnd when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; &l7&rWhom Jason hath received\: and these
Book7Page24=multitude, and of the chief women not a few. &l5&rBut the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and
Book7Page23=&l3&rOpening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. &l4&rAnd some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great
Book7Page22=Chapter 17\nNow when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews\: &l2&rAnd Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
Book7Page21=they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. &l40&rAnd they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia\: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
Book7Page20=have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. &l38&rAnd the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates\: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. &l39&rAnd
Book3Page39=unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them\: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. &l8&rAnd there was great joy in that city. &l9&rBut there was a certain man, called Simon, which
Book3Page38=every where preaching the word. &l5&rThen Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. &l6&rAnd the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. &l7&rFor
Book3Page37=devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. &l3&rAs for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. &l4&rTherefore they that were scattered abroad went
Book3Page36=Chapter 8\nAnd Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. &l2&rAnd
Book3Page35=&l60&rAnd he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Book3Page34=with one accord, &l58&rAnd cast him out of the city, and stoned him\: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul. &l59&rAnd they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
Book3Page33=saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, &l56&rAnd said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. &l57&rThen they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him
Book11Page50=shall see, and not perceive\:
Book3Page32=received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. &l54&rWhen they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. &l55&rBut he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and
Book3Page31=the Holy Ghost\: as your fathers did, so do ye. &l52&rWhich of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers\: &l53&rWho have
Book3Page30=&l49&rHeaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool\: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord\: or what is the place of my rest? &l50&rHath not my hand made all these things? &l51&rYe stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist
Book7Page19=saying, Let those men go. &l36&rAnd the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go\: now therefore depart, and go in peace. &l37&rBut Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and
Book7Page18=their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. &l34&rAnd when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. &l35&rAnd when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants,
Book7Page17=be saved? &l31&rAnd they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. &l32&rAnd they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. &l33&rAnd he took them the same hour of the night, and washed
Book7Page16=&l28&rBut Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm\: for we are all here. &l29&rThen he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, &l30&rAnd brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to
Book7Page15=doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed. &l27&rAnd the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
Book7Page14=their feet fast in the stocks. &l25&rAnd at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God\: and the prisoners heard them. &l26&rAnd suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken\: and immediately all the
Book7Page13=off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. &l23&rAnd when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely\: &l24&rWho, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made
Book7Page12=magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, &l21&rAnd teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. &l22&rAnd the multitude rose up together against them\: and the magistrates rent
Book11Page49=agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, &l26&rSaying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye
Book7Page11=the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. &l19&rAnd when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, &l20&rAnd brought them to the
Book11Page48=expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. &l24&rAnd some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. &l25&rAnd when they
Book7Page10=&l17&rThe same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. &l18&rAnd this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in
Book11Page47=spake any harm of thee. &l22&rBut we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest\: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. &l23&rAnd when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he
Book11Page46=I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you\: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. &l21&rAnd they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or
Book3Page29=fathers, unto the days of David; &l46&rWho found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. &l47&rBut Solomon built him an house. &l48&rHowbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
Book11Page45=when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. &l19&rBut when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. &l20&rFor this cause therefore have
Book3Page28=as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. &l45&rWhich also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our
Book11Page44=the Jews together\: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. &l18&rWho,
Book3Page27=years in the wilderness? &l43&rYea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them\: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. &l44&rOur fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
Book11Page43=courage. &l16&rAnd when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard\: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. &l17&rAnd it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of
Book3Page26=and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. &l42&rThen God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty
Book11Page42=brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days\: and so we went toward Rome. &l15&rAnd from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns\: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took
Book3Page25=back again into Egypt, &l40&rSaying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us\: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. &l41&rAnd they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol,
Book11Page41=sign was Castor and Pollux. &l12&rAnd landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. &l13&rAnd from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium\: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli\: &l14&rWhere we found
Book3Page24=was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers\: who received the lively oracles to give unto us\: &l39&rTo whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned
Book11Page40=island, came, and were healed\: &l10&rWho also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. &l11&rAnd after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose
Book3Page23=Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. &l37&rThis is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. &l38&rThis is he, that
Book3Page22=they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. &l36&rHe brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of
Book3Page21=the place where thou standest is holy ground. &l34&rI have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. &l35&rThis Moses whom
Book3Page20=the voice of the Lord came unto him, &l32&rSaying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. &l33&rThen said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet\: for
Book3Page9=place. &l8&rAnd he gave him the covenant of circumcision\: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs. &l9&rAnd the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt\: but
Book3Page8=sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. &l7&rAnd the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God\: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this
Book3Page7=&l5&rAnd he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on\: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. &l6&rAnd God spake on this wise, That his seed should
Book3Page6=of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. &l4&rThen came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran\: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
Book11Page39=courteously. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux\: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. &l9&rSo when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
Book3Page5=Chapter 7\nThen said the high priest, Are these things so? &l2&rAnd he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, &l3&rAnd said unto him, Get thee out
Book11Page38=had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. &l7&rIn the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days
Book3Page4=change the customs which Moses delivered us. &l15&rAnd all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
Book11Page37=is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. &l5&rAnd he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. &l6&rHowbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly\: but after they
Book3Page3=brought him to the council, &l13&rAnd set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law\: &l14&rFor we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall
Book11Page36=&l3&rAnd when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. &l4&rAnd when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man
Book3Page2=the spirit by which he spake. &l11&rThen they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. &l12&rAnd they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and
Book3Page19=where he begat two sons. &l30&rAnd when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. &l31&rWhen Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight\: and as he drew near to behold it,
Book11Page35=Chapter 28\nAnd when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. &l2&rAnd the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness\: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
Book3Page1=Chapter 6 Cont.\nThen there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. &l10&rAnd they were not able to resist the wisdom and
Book3Page18=&l27&rBut he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? &l28&rWilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? &l29&rThen fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian,
Book11Page34=the sea, and get to land\: &l44&rAnd the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.
Book3Page17=understood how that God by his hand would deliver them\: but they understood not. &l26&rAnd the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
Book11Page33=&l42&rAnd the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. &l43&rBut the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into
Book3Page16=forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. &l24&rAnd seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian\: &l25&rFor he supposed his brethren would have
Book11Page32=hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. &l41&rAnd falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
Book3Page15=father's house three months\: &l21&rAnd when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. &l22&rAnd Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. &l23&rAnd when he was full
Book11Page31=the land\: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. &l40&rAnd when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and
Book3Page14=not Joseph. &l19&rThe same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. &l20&rIn which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his
Book11Page30=cheer, and they also took some meat. &l37&rAnd we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. &l38&rAnd when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. &l39&rAnd when it was day, they knew not
Book3Page13=sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. &l17&rBut when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, &l18&rTill another king arose, which knew
Book3Page12=known unto Pharaoh. &l14&rThen sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. &l15&rSo Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, &l16&rAnd were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the
Book3Page11=Chanaan, and great affliction\: and our fathers found no sustenance. &l12&rBut when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. &l13&rAnd at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made
Book3Page10=God was with him, &l10&rAnd delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. &l11&rNow there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and
