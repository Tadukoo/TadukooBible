Book16Page15=and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.
Book11Page29=for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. &l11&rFor thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. &l12&rBy the swords
Book16Page14=shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. &l26&rSeven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves. &l27&rAnd when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day,
Book11Page28=the Lord GOD. &l9&rI will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. &l10&rYea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid
Book16Page13=without blemish. &l24&rAnd thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD. &l25&rSeven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering\: they
Book11Page27=shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. &l8&rAll the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith
Book16Page12=a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock. &l23&rWhen thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
Book11Page26=earth with thee. &l5&rAnd I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. &l6&rI will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee. &l7&rAnd when I
Book16Page11=and upon the border round about\: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. &l21&rThou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. &l22&rAnd on the second day thou shalt offer
Book11Page25=company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net. &l4&rThen will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole
Book16Page10=that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering. &l20&rAnd thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle,
Book11Page24=young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas\: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers. &l3&rThus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a
Book11Page23=Chapter 32\nAnd it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a
Book11Page22=trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth\: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.
Book11Page21=of the earth. &l17&rThey also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. &l18&rTo whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
Book11Page20=for him. &l16&rI made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit\: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts
Book11Page19=the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning\: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed\: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted
Book11Page18=among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water\: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. &l15&rThus saith
Book11Page17=have left him. &l13&rUpon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches\: &l14&rTo the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top
Book11Page16=the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him\: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and
Book11Page15=up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; &l11&rI have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him\: I have driven him out for his wickedness. &l12&rAnd strangers,
Book11Page14=in his beauty. &l9&rI have made him fair by the multitude of his branches\: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. &l10&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot
Book11Page13=length of his branches\: for his root was by great waters. &l8&rThe cedars in the garden of God could not hide him\: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him
Book11Page12=when he shot forth. &l6&rAll the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. &l7&rThus was he fair in his greatness, in the
Book11Page11=round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. &l5&rTherefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters,
Book11Page10=greatness? &l3&rBehold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. &l4&rThe waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running

Book14Page8=shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. &l21&rAnd I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD\: every man's sword shall
Book14Page7=shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; &l20&rSo that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall
Book14Page6=them? &l18&rAnd it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face. &l19&rFor in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there
Book14Page5=when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. &l17&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against
Book14Page4=all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army\: &l16&rAnd thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me,
Book14Page3=&l14&rTherefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it? &l15&rAnd thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee,
Book14Page2=&l13&rSheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
Book14Page1=Chapter 38 Cont.\nTo take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.
Book2Page50=northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
Book4Page9=nations, and disperse them in the countries. &l16&rBut I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am
Book4Page8=it, though he shall die there. &l14&rAnd I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them. &l15&rAnd they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the
Book4Page7=wall to carry out thereby\: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes. &l13&rMy net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare\: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see
Book4Page6=&l11&rSay, I am your sign\: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them\: they shall remove and go into captivity. &l12&rAnd the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth\: they shall dig through the
Book2Page49=behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. &l5&rThen said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold
Book4Page5=&l9&rSon of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou? &l10&rSay thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.
Book15Page50=defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
Book2Page48=spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. &l4&rAnd,
Book4Page4=my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight. &l8&rAnd in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
Book2Page47=the appearance of fire\: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. &l3&rAnd he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the
Book4Page3=their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight\: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground\: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel. &l7&rAnd I did so as I was commanded\: I brought forth
Book2Page46=Chapter 8\nAnd it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. &l2&rThen I beheld, and lo a likeness as
Book4Page2=&l4&rThen shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing\: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity. &l5&rDig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. &l6&rIn
Book2Page45=troubled\: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
Book4Page1=Chapter 12 Cont.\nTherefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight\: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
Book2Page44=rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. &l27&rThe king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be
Book2Page43=possess their houses\: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. &l25&rDestruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. &l26&rMischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
Book2Page42=and they shall pollute my secret place\: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. &l23&rMake a chain\: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. &l24&rWherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall
Book2Page41=their detestable things therein\: therefore have I set it far from them. &l21&rAnd I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. &l22&rMy face will I turn also from them,
Book2Page40=the wrath of the LORD\: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels\: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. &l20&rAs for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty\: but they made the images of their abominations and of
Book15Page49=the house; and the man stood by me. &l7&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more
Book15Page48=of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. &l5&rSo the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. &l6&rAnd I heard him speaking unto me out of
Book15Page47=&l3&rAnd it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city\: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. &l4&rAnd the glory
Book15Page46=Chapter 43\nAfterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east\: &l2&rAnd, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east\: and his voice was like a noise of many waters\: and the earth shined with his glory.
Book15Page45=hundred reeds with the measuring reed. &l20&rHe measured it by the four sides\: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
Book15Page44=measuring reed round about. &l17&rHe measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. &l18&rHe measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. &l19&rHe turned about to the west side, and measured five
Book15Page43=&l15&rNow when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. &l16&rHe measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the
Book15Page42=therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.
Book15Page41=chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things\: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. &l14&rWhen the priests enter
Book2Page39=horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. &l19&rThey shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed\: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of
Book15Page40=toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them. &l13&rThen said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
Book2Page38=them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. &l17&rAll hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water. &l18&rThey shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and
Book2Page37=is upon all the multitude thereof. &l15&rThe sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within\: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. &l16&rBut they that escape of
Book2Page36=alive\: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. &l14&rThey have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle\: for my wrath
Book2Page35=there be wailing for them. &l12&rThe time is come, the day draweth near\: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn\: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. &l13&rFor the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet
Book2Page34=&l10&rBehold the day, behold, it is come\: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. &l11&rViolence is risen up into a rod of wickedness\: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs\: neither shall
Book2Page33=recompense thee for all thine abominations. &l9&rAnd mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity\: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.
Book2Page32=dwellest in the land\: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. &l8&rNow will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee\: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will

Book2Page30=anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. &l4&rAnd mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity\: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in
Book15Page39=the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they\: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. &l12&rAnd according to the doors of the chambers that were
Book15Page38=entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. &l10&rThe chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. &l11&rAnd the way before them was like
Book15Page37=court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. &l8&rFor the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits\: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. &l9&rAnd from under these chambers was the
Book15Page36=they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts\: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. &l7&rAnd the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter
Book15Page35=chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. &l5&rNow the upper chambers were shorter\: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. &l6&rFor
Book15Page34=was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits. &l3&rOver against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. &l4&rAnd before the
Book15Page33=Chapter 42\nThen he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north\: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. &l2&rBefore the length of an hundred cubits
Book15Page32=on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
Book15Page31=made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. &l26&rAnd there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side,
Book2Page29=Chapter 7\nMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rAlso, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. &l3&rNow is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine
Book15Page30=unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD. &l23&rAnd the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. &l24&rAnd the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door. &l25&rAnd there were
Book2Page28=where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. &l14&rSo will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations\: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
Book2Page27=fury upon them. &l13&rThen shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place
Book2Page26=they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. &l12&rHe that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine\: thus will I accomplish my
Book2Page25=they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them. &l11&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel\! for
Book2Page24=captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols\: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. &l10&rAnd
Book2Page23=&l8&rYet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. &l9&rAnd they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried
Book2Page22=that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. &l7&rAnd the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
Book2Page21=your idols. &l5&rAnd I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. &l6&rIn all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate;
Book2Page20=and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. &l4&rAnd your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken\: and I will cast down your slain men before
Book15Page29=the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other. &l22&rThe altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood\: and he said
Book15Page28=toward the palm tree on the other side\: it was made through all the house round about. &l20&rFrom the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple. &l21&rThe posts of the temple were squared, and the face of
Book15Page27=measure. &l18&rAnd it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; &l19&rSo that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion
Book15Page26=stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; &l17&rTo that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by
Book15Page25=place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court; &l16&rThe door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three
Book15Page24=and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; &l14&rAlso the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. &l15&rAnd he measured the length of the building over against the separate
Book15Page23=the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. &l13&rSo he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place,
Book15Page22=side. &l11&rAnd the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south\: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. &l12&rNow the building that was before
Book15Page21=thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits\: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. &l10&rAnd between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every
Book2Page19=Chapter 6\nAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, &l3&rAnd say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains,
Book15Page20=the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. &l8&rI saw also the height of the house round about\: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. &l9&rThe

Book2Page17=destruction, and which I will send to destroy you\: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread\: &l17&rSo will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through
Book15Page9=wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. &l43&rAnd within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about\: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering. &l44&rAnd without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner
Book2Page16=astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it. &l16&rWhen I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their
Book15Page8=the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices. &l42&rAnd the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high\: whereupon also they laid the instruments
Book2Page15=zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them. &l14&rMoreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. &l15&rSo it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
Book15Page7=&l40&rAnd at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables. &l41&rFour tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of

Book6Page49=Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness\: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted\: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the

Book6Page44=unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God; &l6&rIn the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands\: &l7&rThen said I
Book6Page43=abominations of their fathers\: &l5&rAnd say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand

Book16Page7=even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. &l15&rSo the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns. &l16&rAnd the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four

Book16Page5=thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. &l13&rAnd these are the measures of the altar after the cubits\: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the

Book6Page28=turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. &l27&rAgain, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and
Book6Page27=his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. &l25&rYet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? &l26&rWhen a righteous man
Book6Page26=and live? &l24&rBut when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned\: in
Book6Page25=transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him\: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. &l23&rHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD\: and not that he should return from his ways,
Book6Page24=him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. &l21&rBut if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. &l22&rAll his
Book6Page23=my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. &l20&rThe soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son\: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon
Book6Page22=brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity. &l19&rYet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all
Book6Page21=from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. &l18&rAs for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
Book6Page20=hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, &l16&rNeither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, &l17&rThat hath taken off his hand
Book10Page50=and will execute judgments in No. &l15&rAnd I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
Book6Page9=I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent\: &l23&rIn the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it\: and
Book6Page8=trespass that he hath trespassed against me. &l21&rAnd all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds\: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it. &l22&rThus saith the Lord GOD;
Book6Page7=oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head. &l20&rAnd I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his
Book6Page6=and building forts, to cut off many persons\: &l18&rSeeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape. &l19&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine
Book6Page5=the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. &l17&rNeither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts,
Book6Page4=sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered? &l16&rAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where
Book6Page3=a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him\: he hath also taken the mighty of the land\: &l14&rThat the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand. &l15&rBut he rebelled against him in
Book6Page2=rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon; &l13&rAnd hath taken of the king's seed, and made

Book6Page18=the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, &l13&rHath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase\: shall he then live? he shall not live\: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall

Book6Page16=from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, &l9&rHath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD. &l10&rIf he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood,
Book6Page15=restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; &l8&rHe that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand

Book10Page49=GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt\: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. &l14&rAnd I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan,
Book6Page12=Chapter 18\nThe word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, &l2&rWhat mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? &l3&rAs I live, saith the Lord GOD,
Book10Page48=and fill the land with the slain. &l12&rAnd I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked\: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers\: I the LORD have spoken it. &l13&rThus saith the Lord

Book10Page45=it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. &l7&rAnd they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. &l8&rAnd they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in
Book10Page44=mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. &l6&rThus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down\: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in

Book7Page8=that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD. &l27&rTherefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
Book7Page7=despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. &l25&rWherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live; &l26&rAnd I polluted them in their own gifts, in
Book7Page6=heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth. &l23&rI lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries; &l24&rBecause they had not executed my judgments, but had
Book7Page5=polluted my sabbaths\: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. &l22&rNevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the

Book14Page48=twenty cubits. &l26&rAnd there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them\: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. &l27&rAnd there was a gate in the inner court toward the
Book14Page47=toward the south\: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. &l25&rAnd there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows\: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and
Book14Page46=arches thereof were before them. &l23&rAnd the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. &l24&rAfter that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
Book14Page45=the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. &l22&rAnd their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the
Book14Page44=looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. &l21&rAnd the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate\:
Book14Page43=the length of the gates was the lower pavement. &l19&rThen he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward. &l20&rAnd the gate of the outward court that
Book14Page42=each post were palm trees. &l17&rThen brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about\: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. &l18&rAnd the pavement by the side of the gates over against
Book14Page41=entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits. &l16&rAnd there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches\: and windows were round about inward\: and upon

Book1Page33=against them, and a noise of a great rushing. &l14&rSo the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. &l15&rThen I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that
Book1Page32=spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place. &l13&rI heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over
Book1Page31=thine heart, and hear with thine ears. &l11&rAnd go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. &l12&rThen the

Book18Page7=thousand westward\: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city. &l19&rAnd they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel. &l20&rAll the
Book18Page6=fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. &l18&rAnd the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten
Book18Page5=thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. &l17&rAnd the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and
Book18Page4=that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs\: and the city shall be in the midst thereof. &l16&rAnd these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four
Book18Page3=thousand in breadth\: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. &l14&rAnd they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land\: for it is holy unto the LORD. &l15&rAnd the five thousand,

Book14Page39=cubits. &l12&rThe space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side\: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. &l13&rHe measured then the gate from the roof

Book14Page38=were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure\: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. &l11&rAnd he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen
Book14Page37=one reed. &l8&rHe measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. &l9&rThen measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward. &l10&rAnd the little chambers of the gate eastward

Book8Page3=been in the midst of thee. &l14&rCan thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it. &l15&rAnd I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries,
Book14Page25=my hand that I have laid upon them. &l22&rSo the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward. &l23&rAnd the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity\: because they trespassed
Book8Page2=hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD. &l13&rBehold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath
Book14Page24=for you. &l20&rThus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD. &l21&rAnd I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and
Book8Page1=Chapter 22 Cont.\nAnd one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. &l12&rIn thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou

Book1Page19=likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
Book14Page20=land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it\: after the end of seven months shall they search. &l15&rAnd the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by
Book1Page18=loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. &l28&rAs the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the
Book1Page17=the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. &l27&rAnd I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his
Book1Page16=&l25&rAnd there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. &l26&rAnd above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone\: and upon
Book1Page15=which covered on that side, their bodies. &l24&rAnd when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host\: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Book1Page14=living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. &l23&rAnd under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other\: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two,
Book1Page13=these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them\: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. &l22&rAnd the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the
Book1Page12=from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. &l20&rWhithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them\: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. &l21&rWhen those went,
Book1Page11=when they went. &l18&rAs for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. &l19&rAnd when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them\: and when the living creatures were lifted up
Book1Page10=the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl\: and they four had one likeness\: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. &l17&rWhen they went, they went upon their four sides\: and they turned not

Book14Page18=the passengers on the east of the sea\: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers\: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude\: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog. &l12&rAnd seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
Book14Page17=they shall burn the weapons with fire\: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD. &l11&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of
Book14Page16=weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years\: &l10&rSo that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for
Book14Page15=shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. &l8&rBehold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken. &l9&rAnd they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the
Book14Page14=send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles\: and they shall know that I am the LORD. &l7&rSo will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more\: and the heathen

Book14Page10=&l23&rThus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.
Book9Page49=&l22&rThe merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants\: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. &l23&rHaran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy

Book9Page47=and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. &l18&rDamascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. &l19&rDan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs\:
Book9Page46=the multitude of the wares of thy making\: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. &l17&rJudah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants\: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith,
Book9Page45=Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. &l15&rThe men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand\: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony. &l16&rSyria was thy merchant by reason of
Book9Page44=the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. &l13&rJavan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants\: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. &l14&rThey of the house of
Book9Page43=comeliness. &l11&rThe men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers\: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. &l12&rTarshish was thy merchant by reason of
Book9Page42=in thee thy calkers\: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. &l10&rThey of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war\: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy
Book9Page41=thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee. &l8&rThe inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners\: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots. &l9&rThe ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were
Book9Page40=masts for thee. &l6&rOf the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim. &l7&rFine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be

Ch47=B17P44
Book9Page34=shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it\! &l18&rNow
Ch46=B17P27
Book9Page33=shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments\: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee. &l17&rAnd they

Book13Page30=they may live. &l10&rSo I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. &l11&rThen he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel\: behold, they

Book10Page1=Chapter 27 Cont.\nThe ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market\: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. &l26&rThy rowers have brought thee into great waters\: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the

Book13Page28=ye shall know that I am the LORD. &l7&rSo I prophesied as I was commanded\: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. &l8&rAnd when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them,
Book13Page27=&l5&rThus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live\: &l6&rAnd I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and

Book13Page25=Chapter 37\nThe hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, &l2&rAnd caused me to pass by them round about\: and, behold, there were very many in the open
Book13Page24=solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men\: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
Book13Page23=the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it. &l37&rThus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. &l38&rAs the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her
Book13Page22=become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited. &l36&rThen the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate\: I
Book13Page21=iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. &l34&rAnd the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. &l35&rAnd they shall say, This land that was desolate is
Book13Page20=your abominations. &l32&rNot for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you\: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. &l33&rThus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your
Book13Page19=the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. &l31&rThen shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for
Book13Page18=your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. &l29&rI will also save you from all your uncleannesses\: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. &l30&rAnd I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and
Book13Page17=away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. &l27&rAnd I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. &l28&rAnd ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to
Book13Page16=your own land. &l25&rThen will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean\: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. &l26&rA new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you\: and I will take
Book13Page15=in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. &l24&rFor I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into
Book13Page14=the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. &l23&rAnd I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned
Book13Page13=to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land. &l21&rBut I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. &l22&rTherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith
Book13Page12=scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries\: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them. &l20&rAnd when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said
Book13Page11=their own way and by their doings\: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. &l18&rWherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it\: &l19&rAnd I
Book13Page10=reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD. &l16&rMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l17&rSon of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by

Book4Page49=Chapter 15\nAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? &l3&rShall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to
Book17Page50=them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length\:
Book4Page48=concerning all that I have brought upon it. &l23&rAnd they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings\: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.
Book4Page47=shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters\: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings\: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even
Book4Page46=their righteousness. &l21&rFor thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast? &l22&rYet, behold, therein

Book11Page7=that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. &l26&rAnd I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know
Book4Page41=when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it\: &l14&rThough these three men, Noah,
Book11Page6=put my sword in his hand\: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. &l25&rBut I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know
Book4Page40=house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD. &l12&rThe word of the LORD came again to me, saying, &l13&rSon of man,

Book17Page32=could not be passed over. &l6&rAnd he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. &l7&rNow when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side
Book4Page29=bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies? &l20&rWherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to
Book17Page31=waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins. &l5&rAfterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over\: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that
Book4Page28=armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls\! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you? &l19&rAnd will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of
Book17Page30=side. &l3&rAnd when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ancles. &l4&rAgain he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the
Book4Page27=saith the Lord GOD. &l17&rLikewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, &l18&rAnd say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all
Book4Page26=that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it; &l16&rTo wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,
Book4Page25=and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof\: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. &l15&rThus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
Book4Page24=saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it. &l14&rSo will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter,
Book4Page23=fall\: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it. &l12&rLo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? &l13&rTherefore thus
Book4Page22=the Lord GOD. &l10&rBecause, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter\: &l11&rSay unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall
Book4Page21=be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies\: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am
Book4Page20=spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken? &l8&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD. &l9&rAnd mine hand shall
Book17Page29=right side of the house, at the south side of the altar. &l2&rThen brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right
Book17Page28=Chapter 47\n &l1&rAfterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward\: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the
Book17Page27=boil the sacrifice of the people.
Book17Page26=&l23&rAnd there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. &l24&rThen said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall
Book17Page25=caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. &l22&rIn the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad\: these four corners were of one measure.
Book17Page24=the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. &l21&rThen he brought me forth into the utter court, and
Book17Page23=possession. &l19&rAfter he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north\: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. &l20&rThen said he unto me, This is
Book17Page22=them. &l18&rMoreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession\: that my people be not scattered every man from his
Book4Page19=in the day of the LORD. &l6&rThey have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith\: and the LORD hath not sent them\: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word. &l7&rHave ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not
Book17Page21=be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance. &l17&rBut if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince\: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for
Book4Page18=unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing\! &l4&rO Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. &l5&rYe have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle
Book17Page20=ordinance unto the LORD. &l15&rThus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering. &l16&rThus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall
Book4Page17=Chapter 13\nAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD; &l3&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Woe
Book4Page16=prophesieth of the times that are far off. &l28&rTherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.
Book4Page15=rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD. &l26&rAgain the word of the LORD came to me, saying, &l27&rSon of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he
Book4Page14=vision. &l24&rFor there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. &l25&rFor I am the LORD\: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged\: for in your days, O
Book4Page13=days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? &l23&rTell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every
Book4Page12=cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. &l21&rAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l22&rSon of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The
Book4Page11=of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. &l20&rAnd the
Book4Page10=the LORD. &l17&rMoreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, &l18&rSon of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness; &l19&rAnd say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants
Book17Page19=blemish\: thou shalt prepare it every morning. &l14&rAnd thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual
Book17Page18=prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day\: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate. &l13&rThou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without
Book17Page17=the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. &l12&rNow when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
Book17Page16=over against it. &l10&rAnd the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth. &l11&rAnd in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to
Book17Page15=the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate\: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth
Book17Page14=to an ephah. &l8&rAnd when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. &l9&rBut when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by
Book17Page13=young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram\: they shall be without blemish. &l7&rAnd he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil
Book17Page12=six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. &l5&rAnd the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. &l6&rAnd in the day of the new moon it shall be a
Book17Page11=be shut until the evening. &l3&rLikewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. &l4&rAnd the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be
Book17Page10=the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate\: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not

Book12Page8=turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. &l19&rBut if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby. &l20&rYet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye
Book12Page7=hath committed shall be mentioned unto him\: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. &l17&rYet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal\: but as for them, their way is not equal. &l18&rWhen the righteous
Book12Page6=from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; &l15&rIf the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. &l16&rNone of his sins that he
Book12Page5=live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. &l14&rAgain, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn
Book12Page4=wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. &l13&rWhen I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely
Book12Page3=live\: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? &l12&rTherefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression\: as for the
Book12Page2=speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? &l11&rSay unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and
Book12Page1=Chapter 33 Cont.\nNevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. &l10&rTherefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye
Book8Page50=&l12&rShe hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her\: her scum shall be in the fire.
Book8Page49=fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. &l11&rThen set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
Book8Page48=cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. &l9&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city\! I will even make the pile for fire great. &l10&rHeap on wood, kindle the
Book8Page47=therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it\! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it. &l7&rFor her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; &l8&rThat it might
Book8Page46=it with the choice bones. &l5&rTake the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. &l6&rWherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is
Book8Page45=same day. &l3&rAnd utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it\: &l4&rGather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill
Book8Page44=Chapter 24\nAgain in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day\: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this
Book8Page43=that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. &l49&rAnd they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols\: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
Book8Page42=removed and spoiled. &l47&rAnd the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. &l48&rThus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land,
Book8Page41=shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. &l46&rFor thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be
Book8Page40=in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them? &l44&rYet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot\: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women. &l45&rAnd the righteous men, they
Book8Page39=&l42&rAnd a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her\: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. &l43&rThen said I unto her that was old
Book8Page38=a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came\: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, &l41&rAnd satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
Book8Page37=&l39&rFor when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. &l40&rAnd furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom
Book8Page36=committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. &l38&rMoreover this they have done unto me\: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
Book8Page35=and thy whoredoms. &l36&rThe LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; &l37&rThat they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they
Book8Page34=and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts\: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. &l35&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness
Book8Page33=thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. &l33&rThou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. &l34&rThou shalt even drink it and suck it out,
Book8Page32=whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols. &l31&rThou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. &l32&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large\:
Book8Page31=deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare\: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. &l30&rI will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
Book8Page30=thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. &l28&rFor thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated\: &l29&rAnd they shall
Book8Page29=daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. &l26&rThey shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. &l27&rThus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt\: so that
Book8Page28=judge thee according to their judgments. &l25&rAnd I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee\: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword\: they shall take thy sons and thy
Book8Page27=them riding upon horses. &l24&rAnd they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about\: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall

Book8Page24=multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. &l20&rFor she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
Book8Page23=their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. &l18&rSo she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness\: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. &l19&rYet she
Book8Page22=the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity\: &l16&rAnd as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. &l17&rAnd the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with
Book8Page21=her whoredoms\: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, &l15&rGirded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of

Book12Page49=Chapter 36\nAlso, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD\: &l2&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in
Book8Page11=wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. &l28&rAnd her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not
Book12Page48=was desolate, so will I do unto thee\: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it\: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
Book8Page10=things\: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. &l27&rHer princes in the midst thereof are like
Book12Page47=boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me\: I have heard them. &l14&rThus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. &l15&rAs thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it
Book12Page46=judged thee. &l12&rAnd thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. &l13&rThus with your mouth ye have
Book12Page45=it; whereas the LORD was there\: &l11&rTherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have
Book12Page44=that are slain with the sword. &l9&rI will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return\: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. &l10&rBecause thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess
Book12Page43=pursue thee. &l7&rThus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. &l8&rAnd I will fill his mountains with his slain men\: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall
Book12Page42=the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end\: &l6&rTherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee\: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall
Book12Page41=hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. &l4&rI will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. &l5&rBecause thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by
Book12Page40=Chapter 35\nMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, &l3&rAnd say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine
Book12Page39=God, saith the Lord GOD.
Book12Page38=bear the shame of the heathen any more. &l30&rThus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD. &l31&rAnd ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
Book12Page37=prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid. &l29&rAnd I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither
Book12Page36=shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them. &l28&rAnd they shall no more be a
Book12Page35=sleep in the woods. &l26&rAnd I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. &l27&rAnd the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
Book12Page34=LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it. &l25&rAnd I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land\: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and
Book12Page33=save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. &l23&rAnd I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. &l24&rAnd I the
Book12Page32=unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. &l21&rBecause ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; &l22&rTherefore will I
Book12Page31=to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? &l19&rAnd as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. &l20&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD
Book12Page30=flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats. &l18&rSeemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and
Book12Page29=seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick\: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. &l17&rAnd as for you, O my
Book12Page28=upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be\: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. &l15&rI will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. &l16&rI will
Book12Page27=them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. &l14&rI will feed them in a good pasture, and
Book12Page26=out. &l12&rAs a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. &l13&rAnd I will bring
Book12Page25=from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. &l11&rFor thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them
Book12Page24=flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; &l9&rTherefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; &l10&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease
Book12Page23=&l7&rTherefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; &l8&rAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my
Book12Page22=meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered. &l6&rMy sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill\: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
Book12Page21=that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. &l5&rAnd they were scattered, because there is no shepherd\: and they became
Book12Page20=not the shepherds feed the flocks? &l3&rYe eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed\: but ye feed not the flock. &l4&rThe diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up
Book12Page19=Chapter 34\nAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves\! should
Book12Page18=this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
Book12Page17=shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. &l32&rAnd, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument\: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. &l33&rAnd when
Book12Page16=saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. &l31&rAnd they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them\: for with their mouth they
Book12Page15=desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. &l30&rAlso, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother,
Book12Page14=pestilence. &l28&rFor I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. &l29&rThen shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most
Book12Page13=unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the
Book12Page12=with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood\: and shall ye possess the land? &l26&rYe stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife\: and shall ye possess the land? &l27&rSay thou thus
Book12Page11=saying, &l24&rSon of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land\: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. &l25&rWherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat
Book7Page50=their fathers' nakedness\: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
Book12Page10=smitten. &l22&rNow the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. &l23&rThen the word of the LORD came unto me,
Book2Page9=judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. &l7&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done
Book2Page8=have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her. &l6&rAnd she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her\: for they have refused my
Book2Page7=number, and bind them in thy skirts. &l4&rThen take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel. &l5&rThus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem\: I
Book2Page6=the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled\: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife\: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. &l3&rThou shalt also take thereof a few in
Book2Page5=Chapter 5\nAnd thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's rasor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard\: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair. &l2&rThou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of
Book2Page4=with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
Book2Page3=said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem\: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment\: &l17&rThat they may want bread and water, and be astonied one
Book2Page2=I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. &l15&rThen he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. &l16&rMoreover he
Book7Page49=the widow. &l8&rThou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. &l9&rIn thee are men that carry tales to shed blood\: and in thee they eat upon the mountains\: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. &l10&rIn thee have they discovered
Book2Page1=Chapter 4 Cont.\nAnd the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them. &l14&rThen said I, Ah Lord GOD\! behold, my soul hath not been polluted\: for from my youth up even till now have
Book7Page48=&l6&rBehold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. &l7&rIn thee have they set light by father and mother\: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger\: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and
Book7Page47=draw near, and art come even unto thy years\: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries. &l5&rThose that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.
Book7Page46=in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. &l4&rThou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to
Book7Page45=Chapter 22\nMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rNow, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. &l3&rThen say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood
Book7Page44=my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy. &l32&rThou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered\: for I the LORD have spoken it.
Book7Page43=iniquity shall have an end. &l30&rShall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. &l31&rAnd I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of
Book7Page42=drawn\: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering\: &l29&rWhiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their
Book7Page41=it\: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him. &l28&rAnd thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is
Book7Page40=Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, &l26&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown\: this shall not be the same\: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. &l27&rI will overturn, overturn, overturn,
Book3Page50=Chapter 12\nThe word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not\: for they are a rebellious house.
Book7Page39=made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. &l25&rAnd thou, profane wicked prince of
Book7Page38=mount, and to build a fort. &l23&rAnd it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths\: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken. &l24&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have
Ch9=B3P19
Book7Page37=consulted with images, he looked in the liver. &l22&rAt his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a
Ch8=B3P10
Book7Page36=&l20&rAppoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. &l21&rFor the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination\: he made his arrows bright, he
Ch7=B2P45
Book7Page35=of the LORD came unto me again, saying, &l19&rAlso, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come\: both twain shall come forth out of one land\: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
Ch6=B2P28
Book7Page34=is wrapped up for the slaughter. &l16&rGo thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set. &l17&rI will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest\: I the LORD have said it. &l18&rThe word
Ch5=B2P18
Book7Page33=of the slain\: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. &l15&rI have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied\: ah\! it is made bright, it
Ch4=B2P4
Book7Page32=thy thigh. &l13&rBecause it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD. &l14&rThou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword
Ch3=B1P42
Book7Page31=sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. &l12&rCry and howl, son of man\: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel\: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people\: smite therefore upon
Ch2=B1P25
Book7Page30=furbished\: &l10&rIt is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter\: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree. &l11&rAnd he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled\: this sword is
Ch1=B1P19
Book3Page49=the LORD had shewed me.
Book3Page48=of the city. &l24&rAfterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. &l25&rThen I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that
Book16Page50=lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.
Book3Page47=&l22&rThen did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. &l23&rAnd the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side
Book3Page46=and do them\: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. &l21&rBut as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.
Book3Page45=thereof from thence. &l19&rAnd I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh\: &l20&rThat they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
Book3Page44=gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. &l18&rAnd they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations
Book3Page43=Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. &l17&rTherefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even
Book3Page42=even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD\: unto us is this land given in possession. &l16&rTherefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
Book3Page41=Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD\! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? &l14&rAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l15&rSon of man, thy brethren,
Book3Page40=of Israel\: &l12&rAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD\: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, when I prophesied, that
Book7Page29=knees shall be weak as water\: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD. &l8&rAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l9&rSon of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also
Book7Page28=sigh before their eyes. &l7&rAnd it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh\: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all
Book16Page49=and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley\: &l14&rConcerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer\: &l15&rAnd one
Book7Page27=against all flesh from the south to the north\: &l5&rThat all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath\: it shall not return any more. &l6&rSigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness
Book7Page26=am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. &l4&rSeeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath
Book16Page48=thereof shall be after the homer. &l12&rAnd the shekel shall be twenty gerahs\: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. &l13&rThis is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat,
Book16Page47=saith the Lord GOD. &l10&rYe shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. &l11&rThe ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer\: the measure
Book7Page25=Chapter 21\nAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, &l3&rAnd say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I
Book7Page24=and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein. &l48&rAnd all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it\: it shall not be quenched. &l49&rThen said I, Ah Lord GOD\! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?
Book16Page46=rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. &l9&rThus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel\: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people,
Book16Page45=side westward, and from the east side eastward\: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. &l8&rIn the land shall be his possession in Israel\: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the
Book7Page23=the south field; &l47&rAnd say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree\: the flaming flame shall not be quenched,
Book7Page22=according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. &l45&rMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l46&rSon of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of
Book16Page44=Israel. &l7&rAnd a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west

Book7Page21=wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed. &l44&rAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor
Book7Page20=the heathen. &l42&rAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. &l43&rAnd there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
Book16Page42=shall come near to minister unto the LORD\: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary. &l5&rAnd the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house,

Book3Page34=Chapter 11\n &l1&rMoreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward\: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of
Book11Page50=mouth, and warn them from me. &l8&rWhen I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
Book3Page33=every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. &l22&rAnd the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves\: they went every one straight forward.
Book3Page32=of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. &l20&rThis is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims. &l21&rEvery one had four faces apiece, and
Book3Page31=off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. &l19&rAnd the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight\: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate
Book3Page30=earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. &l17&rWhen they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also\: for the spirit of the living creature was in them. &l18&rThen the glory of the LORD departed from
Book7Page19=the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. &l41&rI will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before
Book7Page18=with your idols. &l40&rFor in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me\: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and
Book16Page39=Chapter 45\n &l1&rMoreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land\: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand.
Book7Page17=Israel\: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. &l39&rAs for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me\: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and
Book16Page38=or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
Book7Page16=rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant\: &l38&rAnd I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me\: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of
Book7Page15=into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. &l36&rLike as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD. &l37&rAnd I will cause you to pass under the
Book16Page37=oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's\: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house. &l31&rThe priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
Book16Page36=possession in Israel\: I am their possession. &l29&rThey shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs. &l30&rAnd the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
Book7Page14=fury poured out, will I rule over you\: &l34&rAnd I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. &l35&rAnd I will bring you
Book7Page13=that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone. &l33&rAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with
Book16Page35=the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD. &l28&rAnd it shall be unto them for an inheritance\: I am their inheritance\: and ye shall give them no
Book16Page34=person to defile themselves\: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. &l26&rAnd after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. &l27&rAnd in
Book11Page49=come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand. &l7&rSo thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my
Book7Page12=your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day\: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you. &l32&rAnd
Book11Page48=&l5&rHe heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. &l6&rBut if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword
Book7Page11=ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. &l30&rWherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations? &l31&rFor when ye offer
Book16Page33=the clean. &l24&rAnd in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments\: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. &l25&rAnd they shall come at no dead
Book16Page32=her that is put away\: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. &l23&rAnd they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and
Book11Page47=&l3&rIf when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; &l4&rThen whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
Book7Page10=trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering\: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings. &l29&rThen I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto
Book3Page29=the face of an eagle. &l15&rAnd the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. &l16&rAnd when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them\: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the
Book11Page46=Chapter 33\nAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l2&rSon of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman\:
Book16Page31=&l20&rNeither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads. &l21&rNeither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. &l22&rNeither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor
Book16Page30=into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
Book3Page28=they four had. &l13&rAs for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. &l14&rAnd every one had four faces\: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth
Book11Page45=and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.
Book3Page27=not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. &l12&rAnd their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that
Book11Page44=their shame with them that go down to the pit. &l31&rPharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. &l32&rFor I have caused my terror in the land of the living\:
Book3Page26=cherub\: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone. &l10&rAnd as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. &l11&rWhen they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
Book11Page43=down to the pit. &l30&rThere be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear
Book3Page25=clothed with linen\: who took it, and went out. &l8&rAnd there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings. &l9&rAnd when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another
Book11Page42=uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword. &l29&rThere is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword\: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go
Book3Page24=from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. &l7&rAnd one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was
Book11Page41=hell with their weapons of war\: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. &l28&rYea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the
Book3Page23=&l5&rAnd the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels,
Book11Page40=multitude\: her graves are round about him\: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living. &l27&rAnd they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to
Book3Page22=went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. &l4&rThen the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.
Book3Page21=said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. &l3&rNow the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man
Book3Page20=Chapter 10\nThen I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. &l2&rAnd he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and
Book16Page29=they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. &l18&rThey shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. &l19&rAnd when they go forth
Book16Page28=shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. &l17&rAnd it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles
Book3Page9=filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger\: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. &l18&rTherefore will I also deal in fury\: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity\: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud
Book3Page8=and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. &l17&rThen he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have
Book16Page27=of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD\: &l16&rThey shall enter into my sanctuary, and they
Book16Page26=and their abominations which they have committed. &l14&rBut I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. &l15&rBut the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge
Book3Page7=abominations than these. &l16&rAnd he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD,
Book3Page6=&l14&rThen he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. &l15&rThen said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
Book16Page25=hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity. &l13&rAnd they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place\: but they shall bear their shame,
Book16Page24=the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them. &l12&rBecause they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine
Book11Page39=uncircumcised, slain by the sword\: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit\: he is put in the midst of them that be slain. &l26&rThere is Meshech, Tubal, and all her
Book3Page5=of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth. &l13&rHe said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.
Book11Page38=earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. &l25&rThey have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude\: her graves are round about him\: all of them
Book3Page4=men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. &l12&rThen said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients
Book16Page23=me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity. &l11&rYet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house\: they shall slay
Book16Page22=sanctuary for yourselves. &l9&rThus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel. &l10&rAnd the Levites that are gone away far from
Book11Page37=of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living. &l24&rThere is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the
Book3Page3=wicked abominations that they do here. &l10&rSo I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. &l11&rAnd there stood before them seventy
Book3Page19=inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
Book11Page36=down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. &l22&rAsshur is there and all her company\: his graves are about him\: all of them slain, fallen by the sword\: &l23&rWhose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave\: all
Book3Page2=&l7&rAnd he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall. &l8&rThen said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall\: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. &l9&rAnd he said unto me, Go in, and behold the
Book16Page21=sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations. &l8&rAnd ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things\: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my
Book16Page20=rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations, &l7&rIn that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
Book3Page1=Chapter 8 Cont.\nHe said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.
Book11Page35=&l20&rThey shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword\: she is delivered to the sword\: draw her and all her multitudes. &l21&rThe strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him\: they are gone
Book3Page18=say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not. &l10&rAnd as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head. &l11&rAnd, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the
Book11Page34=multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. &l19&rWhom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
Book3Page17=thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? &l9&rThen said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness\: for they
Book11Page33=her\: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD. &l17&rIt came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, &l18&rSon of man, wail for the
Book3Page16=them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain\: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. &l8&rAnd it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD\! wilt
Book11Page32=the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD. &l16&rThis is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her\: the daughters of the nations shall lament
Book3Page15=have ye pity\: &l6&rSlay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women\: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. &l7&rAnd he said unto
Book11Page31=waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. &l14&rThen will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD. &l15&rWhen I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and
Book3Page14=and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. &l5&rAnd to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite\: let not your eye spare, neither
Book11Page30=of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them\: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. &l13&rI will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
Book3Page13=from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; &l4&rAnd the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,
Book3Page12=toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side\: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar. &l3&rAnd the glory of the God of Israel was gone up
Book3Page11=Chapter 9\nHe cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. &l2&rAnd, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth
Book3Page10=voice, yet will I not hear them.
Book16Page19=eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. &l6&rAnd thou shalt say to the
Book16Page18=same. &l4&rThen brought he me the way of the north gate before the house\: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD\: and I fell upon my face. &l5&rAnd the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine
Book16Page17=LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. &l3&rIt is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the
Book16Page16=Chapter 44\nThen he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. &l2&rThen said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
