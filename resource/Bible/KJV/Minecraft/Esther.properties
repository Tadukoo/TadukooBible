Book2Page37=the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. &l9&rAnd Harbonah, one of the
Book1Page41=suffer them. &l9&rIf it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed\: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries. &l10&rAnd the king took
Book2Page9=according to the law\: and if I perish, I perish. &l17&rSo Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
Book2Page36=wine in his wrath went into the palace garden\: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. &l8&rThen the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
Book1Page40=unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws\: therefore it is not for the king's profit to
Book2Page8=Mordecai this answer, &l16&rGo, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day\: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not
Book2Page35=Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? &l6&rAnd Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. &l7&rAnd the king arising from the banquet of
Book2Page7=time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed\: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? &l15&rThen Esther bade them return
Book2Page34=sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage. &l5&rThen the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto
Book2Page6=thirty days. &l12&rAnd they told to Mordecai Esther's words. &l13&rThen Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. &l14&rFor if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this
Book2Page33=shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. &l3&rThen Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request\: &l4&rFor we are
Book2Page5=shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live\: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these
Book2Page32=Chapter 7\nSo the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen. &l2&rAnd the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee\: and what is thy request? and it
Book2Page4=&l9&rAnd Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. &l10&rAgain Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai; &l11&rAll the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman,
Book2Page31=and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
Book2Page3=the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
Book2Page30=and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him. &l14&rAnd while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains,
Book2Page2=the city, which was before the king's gate. &l7&rAnd Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. &l8&rAlso he gave him the copy of
Book2Page1=Chapter 4 Cont.\nThen called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was. &l6&rSo Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of
Book3Page19=from mourning into a good day\: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. &l23&rAnd the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; &l24&rBecause
Book3Page18=stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, &l22&rAs the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
Book3Page17=month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another. &l20&rAnd Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, &l21&rTo
Book3Page16=thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. &l19&rTherefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the
Book3Page15=they laid not their hands on the prey, &l17&rOn the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. &l18&rBut the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
Book3Page14=Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. &l16&rBut the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but
Book3Page13=the king commanded it so to be done\: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. &l15&rFor the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at
Book3Page12=request further? and it shall be done. &l13&rThen said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. &l14&rAnd
Book3Page11=unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee\: or what is thy
Book3Page10=&l10&rThe ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. &l11&rOn that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. &l12&rAnd the king said
Book1Page39=Mordecai. &l7&rIn the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. &l8&rAnd Haman said
Book1Page38=then was Haman full of wrath. &l6&rAnd he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai\: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of
Book1Page37=to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand\: for he had told them that he was a Jew. &l5&rAnd when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
Book1Page36=reverenced Haman\: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. &l3&rThen the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment? &l4&rNow it came
Book1Page35=Chapter 3\nAfter these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. &l2&rAnd all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and
Book1Page34=tree\: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
Book1Page33=Ahasuerus. &l22&rAnd the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name. &l23&rAnd when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a
Book2Page29=delighteth to honour. &l12&rAnd Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. &l13&rAnd Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men
Book1Page32=commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. &l21&rIn those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king
Book3Page9=unto those that hated them. &l6&rAnd in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. &l7&rAnd Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, &l8&rAnd Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, &l9&rAnd Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
Book2Page28=nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. &l11&rThen took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king
Book1Page31=gifts, according to the state of the king. &l19&rAnd when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. &l20&rEsther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her\: for Esther did the
Book3Page8=great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces\: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. &l5&rThus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
Book2Page27=before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. &l10&rThen the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate\: let
Book1Page30=than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. &l18&rThen the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave
Book3Page7=could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people. &l3&rAnd all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. &l4&rFor Mordecai was
Book2Page26=head\: &l9&rAnd let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim
Book3Page6=(though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) &l2&rThe Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt\: and no man
Book2Page25=more than to myself? &l7&rAnd Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, &l8&rLet the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his
Book3Page5=Chapter 9\n &l1&rNow in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them,
Book2Page24=standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. &l6&rSo Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour
Book3Page4=Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
Book2Page23=&l4&rAnd the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. &l5&rAnd the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman
Book3Page3=a garment of fine linen and purple\: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. &l16&rThe Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. &l17&rAnd in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the
Book2Page22=chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. &l3&rAnd the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
Book3Page2=camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace. &l15&rAnd Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with
Book2Page21=Chapter 6\nOn that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. &l2&rAnd it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's
Book3Page1=Chapter 8 Cont.\nThe copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. &l14&rSo the posts that rode upon mules and
Book2Page20=thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
Ch10=B3P29
Book1Page29=&l16&rSo Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. &l17&rAnd the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more
Book1Page28=&l15&rNow when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
Book1Page27=and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines\: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
Book1Page26=sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) &l13&rThen thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. &l14&rIn the evening she went,
Book1Page25=when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with
Book1Page24=&l10&rEsther had not shewed her people nor her kindred\: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. &l11&rAnd Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. &l12&rNow
Book2Page19=gate. &l14&rThen said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon\: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the
Book1Page23=&l9&rAnd the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house\: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.
Book2Page18=Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king. &l13&rYet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's
Book1Page22=pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
Book2Page17=his wife. &l11&rAnd Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. &l12&rHaman said moreover, Yea,
Book1Page21=away. &l7&rAnd he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter\: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. &l8&rSo it came to
Book2Page16=heart\: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. &l10&rNevertheless Haman refrained himself\: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh
Book1Page20=was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; &l6&rWho had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried
Book2Page15=and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said. &l9&rThen went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad
Book2Page14=What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee\: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. &l7&rThen answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; &l8&rIf I have found favour in the sight of the king,
Book2Page13=banquet that I have prepared for him. &l5&rThen the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. &l6&rAnd the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine,
Book2Page12=sceptre. &l3&rThen said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom. &l4&rAnd Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the
Book2Page11=the house. &l2&rAnd it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight\: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the
Book2Page10=Chapter 5\n &l1&rNow it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house\: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of
Book1Page19=of the women; and let their things for purification be given them\: &l4&rAnd let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. &l5&rNow in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
Book1Page18=for the king\: &l3&rAnd let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper
Book1Page17=Chapter 2\nAfter these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. &l2&rThen said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought
Book1Page16=provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.
Book1Page15=(for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. &l21&rAnd the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan\: &l22&rFor he sent letters into all the king's
Book1Page14=Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. &l20&rAnd when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire,
Book1Page13=unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. &l19&rIf it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the
Book1Page12=all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. &l18&rLikewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
Book1Page11=answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. &l17&rFor this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto
Book1Page10=Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) &l15&rWhat shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? &l16&rAnd Memucan

Book2Page48=language. &l10&rAnd he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries\: &l11&rWherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to
Book2Page47=provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their
Book2Page46=king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the
Book1Page50=&l4&rSo Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him\: but he received it not.
Book1Page9=&l13&rThen the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment\: &l14&rAnd the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
Book1Page8=with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty\: for she was fair to look on. &l12&rBut the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains\: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
Book2Page45=his hand upon the Jews. &l8&rWrite ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring\: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. &l9&rThen were the
Book2Page44=my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred? &l7&rThen the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid
Book1Page7=day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, &l11&rTo bring Vashti the queen before the king
Book1Page6=compel\: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure. &l9&rAlso Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. &l10&rOn the seventh
Book2Page43=I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces\: &l6&rFor how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto
Book2Page42=devised against the Jews. &l4&rThen the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king, &l5&rAnd said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and
Book1Page5=blue, and white, and black, marble. &l7&rAnd they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king. &l8&rAnd the drinking was according to the law; none did
Book1Page4=seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; &l6&rWhere were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble\: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and
Book2Page41=gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. &l3&rAnd Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had
Book2Page40=Chapter 8\nOn that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. &l2&rAnd the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and
Book1Page3=glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. &l5&rAnd when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small,
Book1Page2=which was in Shushan the palace, &l3&rIn the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him\: &l4&rWhen he shewed the riches of his
