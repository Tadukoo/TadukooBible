Book1Page18=Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. &l4&rAnd Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. &l5&rSo the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a
Book1Page17=Chapter 3\nAnd the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, &l2&rArise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. &l3&rSo Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now

Book1Page14=soul\: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. &l6&rI went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever\: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God. &l7&rWhen my soul
Book1Page13=the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about\: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. &l4&rThen I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. &l5&rThe waters compassed me about, even to the
Book1Page12=Chapter 2\nThen Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly, &l2&rAnd said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. &l3&rFor thou hadst cast me into
Book1Page11=fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Book1Page10=pleased thee. &l15&rSo they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea\: and the sea ceased from her raging. &l16&rThen the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows. &l17&rNow the LORD had prepared a great
Book1Page9=the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. &l14&rWherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood\: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it
Book1Page8=&l12&rAnd he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you\: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. &l13&rNevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not\: for
Book1Page7=unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. &l11&rThen said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
Book1Page6=and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? &l9&rAnd he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. &l10&rThen were the men exceedingly afraid, and said
Book1Page29=&l11&rAnd should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
Book1Page28=be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. &l10&rThen said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night\:
Book1Page5=fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. &l8&rThen said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation?

Book1Page27=pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. &l9&rAnd God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to
Book1Page26=over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. &l7&rBut God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. &l8&rAnd it came to
Book1Page3=mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. &l5&rThen the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
Book1Page2=LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish\: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. &l4&rBut the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a
Book1Page25=angry? &l5&rSo Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. &l6&rAnd the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up
Book1Page24=gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. &l3&rTherefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. &l4&rThen said the LORD, Doest thou well to be
Book1Page1=Chapter 1\nNow the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, &l2&rArise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. &l3&rBut Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the
Book1Page23=Chapter 4\nBut it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. &l2&rAnd he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish\: for I knew that thou art a
