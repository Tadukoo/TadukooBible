Book1Page9=Jerusalem.
Book1Page8=of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. &l11&rAll the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
Book1Page7=the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. &l9&rAnd this is the number of them\: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, &l10&rThirty basons of gold, silver basons
Book1Page6=was willingly offered. &l7&rAlso Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; &l8&rEven those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by
Book1Page5=spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. &l6&rAnd all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that
Book1Page4=with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. &l5&rThen rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose
Book3Page50=Chapter 10\n
Book1Page3=his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. &l4&rAnd whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him
Book1Page2=also in writing, saying, &l2&rThus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. &l3&rWho is there among you of all his people?
Book1Page1=Chapter 1\n &l1&rNow in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it
Book3Page49=trespasses\: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
Book1Page50=building, &l5&rAnd hired counsellers against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Book3Page48=abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? &l15&rO LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous\: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day\: behold, we are before thee in our
Book3Page47=our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; &l14&rShould we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these
Book3Page46=sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever\: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. &l13&rAnd after all that is come upon us for
Book3Page45=land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. &l12&rNow therefore give not your daughters unto their
Book3Page44=to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. &l10&rAnd now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, &l11&rWhich thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The
Book2Page50=&l11&rNow this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.
Book3Page43=eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. &l9&rFor we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and
Book3Page42=captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. &l8&rAnd now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our
Book3Page41=trespass is grown up unto the heavens. &l7&rSince the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to
Book3Page40=and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God, &l6&rAnd said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God\: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our
Book1Page49=with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. &l4&rThen the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in
Book1Page48=for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. &l3&rBut Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do
Book1Page47=Chapter 4\nNow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel; &l2&rThen they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you\:
Book1Page46=many shouted aloud for joy\: &l13&rSo that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people\: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
Book1Page45=foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. &l12&rBut many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and
Book1Page44=king of Israel. &l11&rAnd they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the
Book2Page49=Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. &l10&rFor Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
Book1Page43=their brethren the Levites. &l10&rAnd when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David
Book2Page48=the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. &l8&rAnd he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. &l9&rFor upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
Book1Page42=and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. &l9&rThen stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God\: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and
Book2Page47=Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given\: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. &l7&rAnd there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and
Book2Page46=of Meraioth, &l4&rThe son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, &l5&rThe son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest\: &l6&rThis Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of
Book3Page39=assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. &l5&rAnd at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness;
Book1Page41=month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old
Book2Page45=Chapter 7\nNow after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, &l2&rThe son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, &l3&rThe son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son
Book3Page38=people of those lands\: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. &l3&rAnd when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. &l4&rThen were
Book1Page40=unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. &l8&rNow in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second
Book2Page44=Israel, did eat, &l22&rAnd kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy\: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
Book3Page37=Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. &l2&rFor they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons\: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the
Book2Page43=and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. &l21&rAnd the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of
Book3Page36=Chapter 9\n &l1&rNow when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
Book2Page42=Moses. &l19&rAnd the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. &l20&rFor the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity,
Book3Page35=river\: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
Book2Page41=offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. &l18&rAnd they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of
Book3Page34=all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering\: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD. &l36&rAnd they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the
Book2Page40=priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy, &l17&rAnd offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin
Book3Page33=&l34&rBy number and by weight of every one\: and all the weight was written at that time. &l35&rAlso the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for
Book3Page32=&l33&rNow on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
Book3Page31=of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem\: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. &l32&rAnd we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
Book3Page30=Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. &l30&rSo took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. &l31&rThen we departed from the river
Book1Page39=&l6&rFrom the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. &l7&rThey gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil,
Book1Page38=as the duty of every day required; &l5&rAnd afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.
Book1Page37=of those countries\: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening. &l4&rThey kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom,
Book1Page36=son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. &l3&rAnd they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people
Book1Page35=Chapter 3\nAnd when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. &l2&rThen stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the
Book2Page39=and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. &l15&rAnd this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. &l16&rAnd the children of Israel, the
Book1Page34=garments. &l70&rSo the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
Book2Page38=had sent, so they did speedily. &l14&rAnd the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel,
Book1Page33=is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place\: &l69&rThey gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests'
Book1Page32=hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; &l67&rTheir camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. &l68&rAnd some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which
Book2Page37=hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. &l13&rThen Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king
Book3Page29=unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. &l29&rWatch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
Book1Page31=and two thousand three hundred and threescore, &l65&rBeside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven\: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women. &l66&rTheir horses were seven
Book2Page36=word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. &l12&rAnd the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their
Book3Page28=hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; &l27&rAlso twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. &l28&rAnd I said unto them, Ye are holy
Book1Page30=therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. &l63&rAnd the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim. &l64&rThe whole congregation together was forty
Book2Page35=Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail\: &l10&rThat they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. &l11&rAlso I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
Book3Page27=&l25&rAnd weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellers, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered\: &l26&rI even weighed unto their hand six
Book2Page34=these men, that they be not hindered. &l9&rAnd that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at
Book3Page26=power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. &l23&rSo we fasted and besought our God for this\: and he was intreated of us. &l24&rThen I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
Book2Page33=Jews build this house of God in his place. &l8&rMoreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God\: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expences be given unto
Book3Page25=all our substance. &l22&rFor I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way\: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his
Book2Page32=&l6&rNow therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence\: &l7&rLet the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the
Book3Page24=Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims\: all of them were expressed by name. &l21&rThen I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for
Book2Page31=the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.
Book3Page23=Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; &l19&rAnd Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; &l20&rAlso of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the
Book2Page30=laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; &l4&rWith three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber\: and let the expences be given out of the king's house\: &l5&rAnd also let the golden and silver vessels of
Book3Page22=the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. &l18&rAnd by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and
Book3Page21=and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. &l17&rAnd I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren
Book3Page20=Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days\: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. &l16&rThen sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan,
Book2Page9=city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. &l17&rThen sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell
Book2Page8=in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time\: for which cause was this city destroyed. &l16&rWe certify the king that, if this

Book2Page7=&l14&rNow because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; &l15&rThat search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers\: so shalt thou find
Book4Page21=&l36&rVaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, &l37&rMattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau, &l38&rAnd Bani, and Binnui, Shimei, &l39&rAnd Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah, &l40&rMachnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, &l41&rAzareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah, &l42&rShallum, Amariah,
Book2Page6=the walls thereof, and joined the foundations. &l13&rBe it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.

Book2Page4=Elamites, &l10&rAnd the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time. &l11&rThis is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him,
