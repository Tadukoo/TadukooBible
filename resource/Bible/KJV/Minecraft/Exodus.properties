Book4Page9=morning, the east wind brought the locusts. &l14&rAnd the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt\: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
Book4Page8=upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. &l13&rAnd Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was
Book4Page7=&l11&rNot so\: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. &l12&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up
Book4Page6=and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. &l10&rAnd he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones\: look to it; for evil is before you.
Book2Page49=Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. &l16&rAnd thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
Book4Page5=not yet that Egypt is destroyed? &l8&rAnd Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh\: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God\: but who are they that shall go? &l9&rAnd Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons
Book2Page48=but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. &l13&rAnd he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. &l14&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. &l15&rGet thee unto
Book4Page4=day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. &l7&rAnd Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God\: knowest thou
Book2Page47=his servants, and it became a serpent. &l11&rThen Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers\: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. &l12&rFor they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents\:
Book4Page3=hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field\: &l6&rAnd they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the
Book2Page46=you\: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. &l10&rAnd Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded\: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before
Book4Page2=people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast\: &l5&rAnd they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth\: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the
Book2Page45=them, so did they. &l7&rAnd Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. &l8&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, &l9&rWhen Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
Book4Page1=Chapter 10 Cont.\nAnd Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. &l4&rElse, if thou refuse to let my
Book2Page44=Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. &l5&rAnd the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. &l6&rAnd Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded
Book2Page43=out of his land. &l3&rAnd I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. &l4&rBut Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
Book2Page42=Chapter 7\nAnd the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh\: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. &l2&rThou shalt speak all that I command thee\: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel
Book2Page41=uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
Book2Page40=to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, &l29&rThat the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD\: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. &l30&rAnd Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of
Book2Page39=the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. &l27&rThese are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt\: these are that Moses and Aaron. &l28&rAnd it came
Book2Page38=families of the Korhites. &l25&rAnd Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas\: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. &l26&rThese are that Aaron and Moses, to whom
Book2Page37=Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. &l23&rAnd Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. &l24&rAnd the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph\: these are the

Book2Page31=he let the children of Israel go out of his land. &l12&rAnd Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? &l13&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses
Book2Page30=heritage\: I am the LORD. &l9&rAnd Moses spake so unto the children of Israel\: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. &l10&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, &l11&rGo in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that
Book2Page29=know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. &l8&rAnd I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an

Book2Page27=pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. &l5&rAnd I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. &l6&rWherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will
Book2Page26=&l3&rAnd I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. &l4&rAnd I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their
Book2Page25=Chapter 6\nThen the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh\: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. &l2&rAnd God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD\:
Book2Page24=hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? &l23&rFor since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
Book2Page23=unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. &l22&rAnd Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore
Book2Page22=the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. &l20&rAnd they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh\: &l21&rAnd they said
Book2Page21=own people. &l17&rBut he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle\: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. &l18&rGo therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. &l19&rAnd the officers of
Book2Page20=of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? &l16&rThere is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick\: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine
Book2Page19=straw. &l14&rAnd the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? &l15&rThen the officers
Book2Page18=ought of your work shall be diminished. &l12&rSo the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. &l13&rAnd the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was
Book2Page17=therein; and let them not regard vain words. &l10&rAnd the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. &l11&rGo ye, get you straw where ye can find it\: yet not
Book15Page9=reared up. &l18&rAnd Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. &l19&rAnd he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent
Book2Page16=bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof\: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. &l9&rLet there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
Book15Page8=everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. &l16&rThus did Moses\: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. &l17&rAnd it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was
Book2Page15=burdens. &l6&rAnd Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, &l7&rYe shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore\: let them go and gather straw for themselves. &l8&rAnd the tale of the
Book15Page7=in the priest's office. &l14&rAnd thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats\: &l15&rAnd thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office\: for their anointing shall surely be an
Book2Page14=with the sword. &l4&rAnd the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. &l5&rAnd Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their
Book15Page6=sanctify it. &l12&rAnd thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. &l13&rAnd thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me
Book2Page13=go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. &l3&rAnd they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us\: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or
Book15Page5=and all the vessels thereof\: and it shall be holy. &l10&rAnd thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar\: and it shall be an altar most holy. &l11&rAnd thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and
Book2Page12=Chapter 5\nAnd afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. &l2&rAnd Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel

Book2Page11=affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
Book15Page3=testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. &l6&rAnd thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. &l7&rAnd thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation
Book2Page10=&l30&rAnd Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. &l31&rAnd the people believed\: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
Book15Page2=&l4&rAnd thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. &l5&rAnd thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the
Book15Page1=Chapter 40\nAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rOn the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. &l3&rAnd thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.
Book15Page19=all their journeys.
Book15Page18=journeys\: &l37&rBut if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. &l38&rFor the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout
Book15Page17=was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. &l36&rAnd when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their
Book15Page16=reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. &l34&rThen a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. &l35&rAnd Moses
Book15Page15=there, to wash withal. &l31&rAnd Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat\: &l32&rWhen they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. &l33&rAnd he

Book15Page13=&l26&rAnd he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail\: &l27&rAnd he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. &l28&rAnd he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. &l29&rAnd he put the altar of burnt
Book15Page12=LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. &l24&rAnd he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. &l25&rAnd he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Book15Page11=covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. &l22&rAnd he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. &l23&rAnd he set the bread in order upon it before the
Book15Page10=above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. &l20&rAnd he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark\: &l21&rAnd he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the
Book5Page9=Chapter 13\nAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, &l2&rSanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast\: it is mine. &l3&rAnd Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
Book5Page8=land of Egypt by their armies.
Book5Page7=homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. &l50&rThus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. &l51&rAnd it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the
Book5Page6=thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land\: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. &l49&rOne law shall be to him that is
Book5Page5=thereof. &l46&rIn one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. &l47&rAll the congregation of Israel shall keep it. &l48&rAnd when a stranger shall sojourn with
Book5Page4=Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover\: There shall no stranger eat thereof\: &l44&rBut every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. &l45&rA foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat
Book5Page3=land of Egypt. &l42&rIt is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt\: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. &l43&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses and
Book5Page2=sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. &l41&rAnd it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the
Book5Page1=Chapter 12 Cont.\nAnd they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. &l40&rNow the
Book6Page50=law before God. &l13&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people\: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
Book6Page49=is greater than all gods\: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them. &l12&rAnd Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God\: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in
Book6Page48=hand of the Egyptians. &l10&rAnd Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. &l11&rNow I know that the LORD
Book6Page47=unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. &l9&rAnd Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the
Book6Page46=wife, and her two sons with her. &l7&rAnd Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. &l8&rAnd Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
Book6Page45=from the sword of Pharaoh\: &l5&rAnd Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God\: &l6&rAnd he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy
Book6Page44=after he had sent her back, &l3&rAnd her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land\: &l4&rAnd the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me
Book6Page43=Chapter 18\nWhen Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; &l2&rThen Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
Book6Page42=from under heaven. &l15&rAnd Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi\: &l16&rFor he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Book6Page41=of the sun. &l13&rAnd Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. &l14&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua\: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek
Book6Page40=prevailed. &l12&rBut Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down
Book6Page39=hand. &l10&rSo Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek\: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed\: and when he let down his hand, Amalek
Book6Page38=saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? &l8&rThen came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. &l9&rAnd Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek\: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine
Book6Page37=come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. &l7&rAnd he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD,
Book6Page36=on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. &l6&rBehold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall
Book6Page35=is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? &l4&rAnd Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. &l5&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go
Book6Page34=people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? &l3&rAnd the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore
Book6Page33=Chapter 17\nAnd all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim\: and there was no water for the people to drink. &l2&rWherefore the

Book6Page31=Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. &l35&rAnd the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. &l36&rNow an omer is
Book6Page30=fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. &l33&rAnd Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. &l34&rAs the LORD commanded
Book6Page29=and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. &l32&rAnd Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have
Book6Page28=therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. &l30&rSo the people rested on the seventh day. &l31&rAnd the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna\:
Book6Page27=to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. &l28&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? &l29&rSee, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath,
Book6Page26=therein. &l25&rAnd Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD\: to day ye shall not find it in the field. &l26&rSix days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. &l27&rAnd it came
Book6Page25=bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. &l24&rAnd they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade\: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm
Book6Page24=the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man\: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. &l23&rAnd he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD\:
Book6Page23=some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank\: and Moses was wroth with them. &l21&rAnd they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating\: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. &l22&rAnd it came to pass, that on
Book6Page22=omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. &l19&rAnd Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. &l20&rNotwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but
Book6Page21=according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. &l17&rAnd the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. &l18&rAnd when they did mete it with an
Book6Page20=of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna\: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. &l16&rThis is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man
Book10Page50=of Israel\: for it is an heave offering\: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.
Book6Page9=they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees\: and they encamped there by the waters.
Book6Page8=thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians\: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. &l27&rAnd
Book6Page7=LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet\: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, &l26&rAnd said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD
Book6Page6=no water. &l23&rAnd when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter\: therefore the name of it was called Marah. &l24&rAnd the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? &l25&rAnd he cried unto the
Book6Page5=Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. &l22&rSo Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found
Book6Page4=them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. &l20&rAnd Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. &l21&rAnd Miriam answered them,
Book6Page3=in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established. &l18&rThe LORD shall reign for ever and ever. &l19&rFor the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon
Book6Page2=still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. &l17&rThou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in,
Book6Page1=Chapter 15 Cont.\nThen the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. &l16&rFear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as
Book6Page19=covered the camp\: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. &l14&rAnd when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. &l15&rAnd when the children
Book6Page18=murmurings of the children of Israel\: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. &l13&rAnd it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
Book6Page17=came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. &l11&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, &l12&rI have heard the
Book6Page16=against him\: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. &l9&rAnd Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD\: for he hath heard your murmurings. &l10&rAnd it
Book6Page15=against the LORD\: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? &l8&rAnd Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur
Book6Page14=&l6&rAnd Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt\: &l7&rAnd in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings

Book10Page48=offering made by fire unto the LORD. &l26&rAnd thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD\: and it shall be thy part. &l27&rAnd thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the
Book6Page11=Egypt. &l2&rAnd the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness\: &l3&rAnd the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the
Book10Page47=hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. &l25&rAnd thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD\: it is an

Book14Page42=Moses. &l27&rAnd they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, &l28&rAnd a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, &l29&rAnd a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and

Book1Page38=Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. &l18&rAnd they shall hearken to thy voice\: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The
Book1Page37=of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt\: &l17&rAnd I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
Book1Page36=the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you\: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. &l16&rGo, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
Book1Page35=unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM\: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. &l15&rAnd God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,

Book1Page33=I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? &l12&rAnd he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee\: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this
Book1Page32=wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. &l10&rCome now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. &l11&rAnd Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that
Book1Page31=milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. &l9&rNow therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me\: and I have also seen the oppression
Book1Page30=Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; &l8&rAnd I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with
Book14Page39=with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. &l22&rAnd he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. &l23&rAnd there was
Book14Page38=golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. &l21&rAnd they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod
Book14Page37=ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. &l19&rAnd they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. &l20&rAnd they made two other
Book14Page36=and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. &l17&rAnd they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. &l18&rAnd the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two
Book14Page35=twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. &l15&rAnd they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. &l16&rAnd they made two ouches of gold,
Book14Page34=&l12&rAnd the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. &l13&rAnd the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper\: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. &l14&rAnd the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel,
Book14Page33=thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. &l10&rAnd they set in it four rows of stones\: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle\: this was the first row. &l11&rAnd the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
Book14Page32=as the LORD commanded Moses. &l8&rAnd he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. &l9&rIt was foursquare; they made the breastplate double\: a span was the length
Book14Page31=&l6&rAnd they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. &l7&rAnd he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel;
Book1Page29=&l6&rMoreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. &l7&rAnd the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in
Book14Page30=together\: by the two edges was it coupled together. &l5&rAnd the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Book1Page28=aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. &l5&rAnd he said, Draw not nigh hither\: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Book1Page27=out of the midst of a bush\: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. &l3&rAnd Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. &l4&rAnd when the LORD saw that he turned
Book1Page26=Chapter 3\nNow Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian\: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. &l2&rAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
Book1Page25=groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. &l25&rAnd God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
Book1Page24=strange land. &l23&rAnd it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died\: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. &l24&rAnd God heard their
Book1Page23=ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. &l21&rAnd Moses was content to dwell with the man\: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. &l22&rAnd she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom\: for he said, I have been a stranger in a

Book1Page21=daughters\: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. &l17&rAnd the shepherds came and drove them away\: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. &l18&rAnd when they came to Reuel their father, he
Book1Page20=feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. &l15&rNow when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian\: and he sat down by a well. &l16&rNow the priest of Midian had seven
Book8Page9=out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. &l7&rIf a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen

Book8Page6=Chapter 22\nIf a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. &l2&rIf a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him. &l3&rIf

Book8Page5=they shall divide. &l36&rOr if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

Book1Page19=behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together\: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? &l14&rAnd he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses
Book14Page20=&l21&rThis is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. &l22&rAnd Bezaleel the son of Uri, the

Book1Page13=she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. &l4&rAnd his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. &l5&rAnd the daughter of

Book13Page11=laver and his foot, &l17&rThe hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, &l18&rThe pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, &l19&rThe cloths of service, to do service in the
Book13Page10=&l15&rAnd the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle, &l16&rThe altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the

Book4Page49=Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. &l37&rAnd the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. &l38&rAnd a mixed
Book4Page48=clothes upon their shoulders. &l35&rAnd the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment\: &l36&rAnd the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
Book4Page47=me also. &l33&rAnd the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. &l34&rAnd the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their

Book4Page45=that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. &l30&rAnd Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. &l31&rAnd he
Book4Page44=away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive
Book11Page9=burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD\: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. &l43&rAnd there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified
Book4Page43=shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. &l28&rAnd the children of Israel went

Book11Page7=one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even\: &l40&rAnd with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.
Book4Page41=the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. &l24&rAnd ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. &l25&rAnd it shall
Book11Page6=make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy\: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. &l38&rNow this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. &l39&rThe

Book11Page3=tabernacle of the congregation. &l33&rAnd they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them\: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. &l34&rAnd if ought of the flesh of the consecrations,
Book11Page2=congregation to minister in the holy place. &l31&rAnd thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. &l32&rAnd Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the
Book11Page1=Chapter 29 Cont.\nAnd the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. &l30&rAnd that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
Book4Page39=unleavened bread. &l21&rThen Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. &l22&rAnd ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the
Book4Page38=found in your houses\: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. &l20&rYe shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
Book4Page37=this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. &l18&rIn the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. &l19&rSeven days shall there be no leaven
Book4Page36=work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. &l17&rAnd ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt\: therefore shall ye observe
Book4Page35=whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. &l16&rAnd in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
Book4Page34=you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. &l15&rSeven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses\: for
Book4Page33=the LORD. &l13&rAnd the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are\: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. &l14&rAnd this day shall be unto
Book4Page32=and ye shall eat it in haste\: it is the LORD'S passover. &l12&rFor I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment\: I am

Book4Page28=number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. &l5&rYour lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year\: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats\: &l6&rAnd ye shall keep it up until the
Book4Page27=tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house\: &l4&rAnd if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the
Book4Page26=Chapter 12\nAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, &l2&rThis month shall be unto you the beginning of months\: it shall be the first month of the year to you. &l3&rSpeak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
Book4Page25=wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. &l10&rAnd Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh\: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Book4Page24=me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee\: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. &l9&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my

Book4Page22=that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. &l6&rAnd there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it
Book4Page21=in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. &l4&rAnd Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt\: &l5&rAnd all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
Book4Page20=people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. &l3&rAnd the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt,
Book4Page19=Chapter 11\nAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence\: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. &l2&rSpeak now in the ears of the
Book4Page18=thy face again no more.
Book4Page17=hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. &l28&rAnd Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. &l29&rAnd Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see
Book4Page16=sacrifice unto the LORD our God. &l26&rOur cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. &l27&rBut the LORD

Book4Page13=&l20&rBut the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. &l21&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
Book4Page12=this death only. &l18&rAnd he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. &l19&rAnd the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
Book4Page11=&l16&rThen Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. &l17&rNow therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me
Book4Page10=&l15&rFor they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left\: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Book12Page9=mischief. &l23&rFor they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us\: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. &l24&rAnd I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
Book12Page8=children of Israel drink of it. &l21&rAnd Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? &l22&rAnd Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot\: thou knowest the people, that they are set on
Book12Page7=dancing\: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. &l20&rAnd he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the

Book12Page5=&l16&rAnd the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. &l17&rAnd when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. &l18&rAnd he said, It
Book12Page4=the evil which he thought to do unto his people. &l15&rAnd Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand\: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
Book12Page3=servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. &l14&rAnd the LORD repented of
Book12Page2=speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. &l13&rRemember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy

Book8Page48=them. &l13&rAnd Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua\: and Moses went up into the mount of God. &l14&rAnd he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you\: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you\: if any man have any matters to
Book8Page47=laid not his hand\: also they saw God, and did eat and drink. &l12&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there\: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
Book8Page46=and seventy of the elders of Israel\: &l10&rAnd they saw the God of Israel\: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. &l11&rAnd upon the nobles of the children of Israel he
Book8Page45=said will we do, and be obedient. &l8&rAnd Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words. &l9&rThen went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu,
Book8Page44=of oxen unto the LORD. &l6&rAnd Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. &l7&rAnd he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people\: and they said, All that the LORD hath
Book8Page43=LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. &l5&rAnd he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings
Book8Page42=go up with him. &l3&rAnd Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments\: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. &l4&rAnd Moses wrote all the words of the
Book8Page41=Chapter 24\nAnd he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. &l2&rAnd Moses alone shall come near the LORD\: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people

Book8Page38=before thee. &l29&rI will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. &l30&rBy little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and
Book8Page37=fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. &l28&rAnd I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from

Book8Page35=Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites\: and I will cut them off. &l24&rThou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works\: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. &l25&rAnd ye shall

Book13Page6=saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, &l5&rTake ye from among you an offering unto the LORD\: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, &l6&rAnd blue, and purple, and
Book1Page2=all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls\: for Joseph was in Egypt already. &l6&rAnd Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. &l7&rAnd the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and

Book13Page2=spoken with him in mount Sinai. &l33&rAnd till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. &l34&rBut when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the
Book8Page18=wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. &l25&rIf thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
Book13Page1=Chapter 34 Cont.\nAnd Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him\: and Moses talked with them. &l32&rAnd afterward all the children of Israel came nigh\: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had
Book8Page17=stranger, nor oppress him\: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. &l22&rYe shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. &l23&rIf thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; &l24&rAnd my wrath shall

Book8Page15=if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire. &l16&rAnd if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. &l17&rIf her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the
Book8Page14=he shall not make good that which was torn. &l14&rAnd if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good. &l15&rBut if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good\:
Book8Page13=unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good. &l12&rAnd if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. &l13&rIf it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and
Book8Page12=neighbour. &l10&rIf a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it\: &l11&rThen shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand
Book12Page49=tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. &l29&rAnd it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone

Book8Page10=out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double. &l8&rIf the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods. &l9&rFor all manner of
Book12Page47=neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. &l26&rThe first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. &l27&rAnd the LORD said
Book12Page46=&l24&rFor I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders\: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. &l25&rThou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
Book12Page45=thou shalt rest. &l22&rAnd thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. &l23&rThrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.

Book12Page41=&l15&rLest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; &l16&rAnd thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
Book12Page40=land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee\: &l13&rBut ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves\: &l14&rFor thou shalt worship no other god\: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God\:
Book12Page39=thou that which I command thee this day\: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. &l12&rTake heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the
Book12Page38=covenant\: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation\: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD\: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. &l11&rObserve

Book12Page36=and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. &l8&rAnd Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
Book12Page35=the name of the LORD. &l6&rAnd the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, &l7&rKeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,
Book12Page34=stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. &l5&rAnd the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed
Book12Page33=mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. &l3&rAnd no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. &l4&rAnd he hewed two tables of
Book12Page32=Chapter 34\nAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first\: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. &l2&rAnd be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
Book12Page31=&l23&rAnd I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts\: but my face shall not be seen.
Book12Page30=and live. &l21&rAnd the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock\: &l22&rAnd it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by\:
Book12Page29=goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. &l20&rAnd he said, Thou canst not see my face\: for there shall no man see me,
Book12Page28=the earth. &l17&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken\: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. &l18&rAnd he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. &l19&rAnd he said, I will make all my
Book12Page27=with me, carry us not up hence. &l16&rFor wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of
Book12Page26=shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight\: and consider that this nation is thy people. &l14&rAnd he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. &l15&rAnd he said unto him, If thy presence go not
Book12Page25=thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people\: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. &l13&rNow therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,

Book12Page23=tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. &l10&rAnd all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door\: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent
Book12Page22=&l8&rAnd it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. &l9&rAnd it came to pass, as Moses entered into the
Book12Page21=&l7&rAnd Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.
Book12Page20=people\: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee\: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. &l6&rAnd the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
Book12Page19=stiffnecked people\: lest I consume thee in the way. &l4&rAnd when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned\: and no man did put on him his ornaments. &l5&rFor the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked
Book12Page18=will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite\: &l3&rUnto a land flowing with milk and honey\: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a
Book12Page17=Chapter 33\nAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it\: &l2&rAnd I
Book12Page16=which I have spoken unto thee\: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee\: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. &l35&rAnd the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
Book12Page15=forgive their sin\u00EF\u00BF\u00BD; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. &l33&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. &l34&rTherefore now go, lead the people unto the place of
Book12Page14=a great sin\: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. &l31&rAnd Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. &l32&rYet now, if thou wilt
Book12Page13=&l29&rFor Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. &l30&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned
Book12Page12=gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. &l28&rAnd the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses\: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
Book12Page11=camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. &l27&rAnd he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from

Book12Page10=it off. So they gave it me\: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. &l25&rAnd when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies\:) &l26&rThen Moses stood in the gate of the
Book2Page9=met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. &l28&rAnd Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. &l29&rAnd Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel\:
Book2Page8=cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. &l26&rSo he let him go\: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. &l27&rAnd the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and
Book2Page7=thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. &l24&rAnd it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. &l25&rThen Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and
Book2Page6=put in thine hand\: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. &l22&rAnd thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn\: &l23&rAnd I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me\: and if

Book2Page4=my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. &l19&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt\: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. &l20&rAnd Moses took his wife and
Book2Page3=of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. &l17&rAnd thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. &l18&rAnd Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto

Book3Page48=was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.
Book3Page47=the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. &l34&rAnd when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. &l35&rAnd the heart of Pharaoh
Book3Page46=the barley was smitten\: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. &l32&rBut the wheat and the rie were not smitten\: for they were not grown up. &l33&rAnd Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD\: and
Book3Page45=my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S. &l30&rBut as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. &l31&rAnd the flax and
Book3Page44=my people are wicked. &l28&rIntreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. &l29&rAnd Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad
Book3Page43=and brake every tree of the field. &l26&rOnly in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. &l27&rAnd Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time\: the LORD is righteous, and I and
Book3Page42=the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. &l25&rAnd the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field,
Book3Page41=throughout the land of Egypt. &l23&rAnd Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven\: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. &l24&rSo there was hail, and fire mingled with
Book3Page40=the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. &l22&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
Book7Page29=nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates\: &l11&rFor in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day\: wherefore the
Book7Page28=not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. &l8&rRemember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. &l9&rSix days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work\: &l10&rBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God\: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
Book7Page27=the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; &l6&rAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. &l7&rThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will
Book7Page26=or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth\: &l5&rThou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them\: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
Book7Page25=Chapter 20\nAnd God spake all these words, saying, &l2&rI am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. &l3&rThou shalt have no other gods before me. &l4&rThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,
Book7Page24=thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee\: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. &l25&rSo Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
Book7Page23=sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. &l23&rAnd Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai\: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. &l24&rAnd the LORD said unto him, Away, get
Book7Page22=Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. &l21&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. &l22&rAnd let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
Book7Page21=the whole mount quaked greatly. &l19&rAnd when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. &l20&rAnd the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount\: and the LORD called
Book7Page20=forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. &l18&rAnd mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire\: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and
Book3Page39=the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. &l20&rHe that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses\: &l21&rAnd he that regarded not
Book3Page38=cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. &l19&rSend therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in
Book3Page37=this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. &l17&rAs yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? &l18&rBehold, to morrow about this time I will
Book3Page36=and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. &l15&rFor now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. &l16&rAnd in very deed for
Book3Page35=Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. &l14&rFor I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants,
Book3Page34=not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. &l12&rAnd the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. &l13&rAnd the LORD said unto
Book11Page50=seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people\: &l10&rNow therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them\: and I will make of thee a great nation.
Book3Page33=beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. &l10&rAnd they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. &l11&rAnd the magicians could
Book3Page32=unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. &l9&rAnd it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
Book3Page31=the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. &l7&rAnd Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. &l8&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses and
Book3Page30=there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel. &l5&rAnd the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. &l6&rAnd the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died\: but of
Book7Page19=&l16&rAnd it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. &l17&rAnd Moses brought
Book7Page18=long, they shall come up to the mount. &l14&rAnd Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. &l15&rAnd he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day\: come not at your wives.
Book7Page17=mount, or touch the border of it\: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death\: &l13&rThere shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live\: when the trumpet soundeth
Book7Page16=&l11&rAnd be ready against the third day\: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. &l12&rAnd thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the
Book7Page15=the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. &l10&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
Book7Page14=the LORD commanded him. &l8&rAnd all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. &l9&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that
Book7Page13=&l6&rAnd ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. &l7&rAnd Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which
Book11Page49=the way which I commanded them\: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &l9&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, I have
Book7Page12=unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. &l5&rNow therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people\: for all the earth is mine\:
Book11Page48=and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. &l7&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves\: &l8&rThey have turned aside quickly out of
Book7Page11=the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. &l3&rAnd Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; &l4&rYe have seen what I did
Book11Page47=out of the land of Egypt. &l5&rAnd when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. &l6&rAnd they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings;
Book7Page10=Chapter 19\nIn the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. &l2&rFor they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in
Book3Page29=is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep\: there shall be a very grievous murrain. &l4&rAnd the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt\: and
Book11Page46=the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. &l4&rAnd he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf\: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
Book3Page28=Chapter 9\nThen the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. &l2&rFor if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, &l3&rBehold, the hand of the LORD
Book11Page45=out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. &l2&rAnd Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. &l3&rAnd all the people brake off
Book3Page27=removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. &l32&rAnd Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
Book11Page44=Chapter 32\n &l1&rAnd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up
Book3Page26=from his people, to morrow\: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. &l30&rAnd Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. &l31&rAnd the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he
Book11Page43=Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
Book3Page25=sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away\: intreat for me. &l29&rAnd Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and
Book11Page42=sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. &l17&rIt is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever\: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. &l18&rAnd he gave unto
Book3Page24=abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? &l27&rWe will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. &l28&rAnd Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may
Book11Page41=&l15&rSix days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD\: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. &l16&rWherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the
Book3Page23=&l25&rAnd Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. &l26&rAnd Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God\: lo, shall we sacrifice the
Book11Page40=am the LORD that doth sanctify you. &l14&rYe shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you\: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death\: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Book3Page22=people\: to morrow shall this sign be. &l24&rAnd the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt\: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
Book3Page21=&l22&rAnd I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. &l23&rAnd I will put a division between my people and thy
Book3Page20=&l21&rElse, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses\: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
Book3Page9=bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs\: &l4&rAnd the frogs shall come
Book3Page8=Chapter 8\nAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. &l2&rAnd if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs\: &l3&rAnd the river shall
Book3Page7=seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.
Book3Page6=as the LORD had said. &l23&rAnd Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. &l24&rAnd all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. &l25&rAnd
Book11Page39=commanded thee shall they do. &l12&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, &l13&rSpeak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep\: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I
Book3Page5=stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. &l22&rAnd the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments\: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them;
Book11Page38=his foot, &l10&rAnd the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, &l11&rAnd the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place\: according to all that I have
Book3Page4=and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. &l21&rAnd the fish that was in the river died; and the river
Book11Page37=seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, &l8&rAnd the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, &l9&rAnd the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and
Book3Page3=and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. &l20&rAnd Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded;
Book3Page19=hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. &l20&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Book11Page36=Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan\: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; &l7&rThe tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy
Book3Page2=die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. &l19&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers,
Book3Page1=Chapter 7 Cont.\nThus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD\: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. &l18&rAnd the fish that is in the river shall

Book3Page17=lice throughout all the land of Egypt. &l17&rAnd they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
Book11Page33=shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. &l38&rWhosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.
Book3Page16=stank. &l15&rBut when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. &l16&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become
Book11Page32=put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee\: it shall be unto you most holy. &l37&rAnd as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof\: it
Book3Page15=of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. &l13&rAnd the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. &l14&rAnd they gathered them together upon heaps\: and the land

Book11Page30=it shall be holy unto you. &l33&rWhosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. &l34&rAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum;

Book3Page11=Egypt. &l6&rAnd Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. &l7&rAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. &l8&rThen Pharaoh called for
