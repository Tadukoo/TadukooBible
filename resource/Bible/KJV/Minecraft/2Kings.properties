Book2Page50=Chapter 6\nAnd the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
Book3Page29=said one to another, We do not well\: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace\: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us\: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household. &l10&rSo they came and
Book3Page28=uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it. &l9&rThen they
Book3Page27=Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. &l7&rWherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. &l8&rAnd when these lepers came to the
Book3Page26=there was no man there. &l6&rFor the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host\: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the
Book3Page25=the host of the Syrians\: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. &l5&rAnd they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians\: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold,
Book6Page49=to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. &l38&rAnd Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father\: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
Book3Page24=of the gate\: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? &l4&rIf we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there\: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto
Book6Page48=incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. &l36&rNow the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l37&rIn those days the LORD began
Book3Page23=king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. &l3&rAnd there were four leprous men at the entering in
Book6Page47=mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. &l34&rAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD\: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. &l35&rHowbeit the high places were not removed\: the people sacrificed and burned
Book3Page22=Chapter 7\nThen Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. &l2&rThen a lord on whose hand the
Book6Page46=kings of Israel. &l32&rIn the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. &l33&rFive and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his
Book3Page21=LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?
Book6Page45=Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. &l31&rAnd the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
Book3Page20=look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door\: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him? &l33&rAnd while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him\: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the
Book6Page44=came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. &l30&rAnd Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against
Book6Page43=began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. &l28&rAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD\: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. &l29&rIn the days of Pekah king of Israel
Book6Page42=and reigned in his room. &l26&rAnd the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. &l27&rIn the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah
Book6Page41=of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. &l25&rBut Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites\: and he killed him,
Book6Page40=&l23&rIn the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. &l24&rAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD\: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son
Book2Page49=leper as white as snow.
Book2Page48=receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? &l27&rThe leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
Book2Page47=and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. &l26&rAnd he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to
Book2Page46=changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him. &l24&rAnd when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house\: and he let the men go, and they departed. &l25&rBut he went in,
Book2Page45=mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets\: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. &l23&rAnd Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
Book2Page44=&l21&rSo Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? &l22&rAnd he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from
Book2Page43=him a little way. &l20&rBut Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought\: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
Book2Page42=the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon\: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. &l19&rAnd he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from
Book2Page41=pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. &l18&rIn this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into
Book2Page40=earth, but in Israel\: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. &l16&rBut he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused. &l17&rAnd Naaman said, Shall there not then, I
Book3Page19=stand on him this day. &l32&rBut Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him\: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?
Book3Page18=the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh. &l31&rThen he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall
Book3Page17=son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. &l29&rSo we boiled my son, and did eat him\: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him\: and she hath hid her son. &l30&rAnd it came to pass, when the king heard
Book3Page16=saying, Help, my lord, O king. &l27&rAnd he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? &l28&rAnd the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy
Book3Page9=them. &l17&rAnd Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw\: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. &l18&rAnd when they
Book3Page15=and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. &l26&rAnd as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him,
Book6Page39=stayed not there in the land. &l21&rAnd the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? &l22&rAnd Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
Book3Page8=was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master\! how shall we do? &l16&rAnd he answered, Fear not\: for they that be with us are more than they that be with
Book3Page14=went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. &l24&rAnd it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. &l25&rAnd there was a great famine in Samaria\:
Book6Page38=his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. &l20&rAnd Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and
Book3Page7=that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. &l14&rTherefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host\: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. &l15&rAnd when the servant of the man of God
Book3Page13=thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. &l23&rAnd he prepared great provision for them\: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they
Book6Page37=that which was evil in the sight of the LORD\: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. &l19&rAnd Pul the king of Assyria came against the land\: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that
Book3Page6=of us is for the king of Israel? &l12&rAnd one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king\: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. &l13&rAnd he said, Go and spy where he is,
Book3Page12=they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria. &l21&rAnd the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them? &l22&rAnd he answered, Thou shalt not smite them\: wouldest thou smite those whom
Book6Page36=to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. &l17&rIn the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. &l18&rAnd he did
Book3Page5=place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice. &l11&rTherefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which
Book3Page11=follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria. &l20&rAnd it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and
Book6Page35=the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. &l16&rThen Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah\: because they opened not
Book3Page4=with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp. &l9&rAnd the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. &l10&rAnd the king of Israel sent to the
Book3Page10=came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. &l19&rAnd Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city\:
Book6Page34=year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria. &l14&rFor Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. &l15&rAnd the rest of
Book3Page3=it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim. &l7&rTherefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it. &l8&rThen the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
Book6Page33=kings of Israel. &l12&rThis was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And so it came to pass. &l13&rShallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
Book3Page2=will go. &l4&rSo he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. &l5&rBut as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water\: and he cried, and said, Alas, master\! for it was borrowed. &l6&rAnd the man of God said, Where fell
Book6Page32=Israel to sin. &l10&rAnd Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. &l11&rAnd the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
Book3Page1=Chapter 6 Cont.\nLet us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. &l3&rAnd one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I
Book6Page31=Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. &l9&rAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done\: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Book6Page30=are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l7&rSo Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David\: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. &l8&rIn the thirty and eighth year of
Book9Page50=the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
Book2Page39=of God\: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. &l15&rAnd he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him\: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the
Book2Page38=father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? &l14&rThen went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man
Book2Page37=recover the leper. &l12&rAre not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. &l13&rAnd his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
Book2Page36=flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. &l11&rBut Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and
Book2Page35=and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. &l9&rSo Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. &l10&rAnd Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy
Book2Page34=I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. &l8&rAnd it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me,
Book2Page33=recover him of his leprosy. &l7&rAnd it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider,
Book2Page32=talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. &l6&rAnd he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest
Book2Page31=leprosy. &l4&rAnd one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. &l5&rAnd the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten
Book2Page30=out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. &l3&rAnd she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria\! for he would recover him of his
Book6Page29=&l5&rAnd the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land. &l6&rAnd the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did,
Book6Page28=Jecholiah of Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done; &l4&rSave that the high places were not removed\: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
Book6Page27=Chapter 15\nIn the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. &l2&rSixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
Book6Page26=book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? &l29&rAnd Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
Book6Page25=saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. &l28&rNow the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the
Book9Page49=might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. &l11&rAnd he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in
Book6Page24=Gathhepher. &l26&rFor the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter\: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. &l27&rAnd the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven\: but he
Book9Page48=&l9&rNevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. &l10&rAnd he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man
Book6Page23=Israel to sin. &l25&rHe restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of
Book9Page47=&l8&rAnd he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
Book6Page22=king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years. &l24&rAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD\: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Book9Page46=brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. &l7&rAnd he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
Book6Page21=people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. &l22&rHe built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. &l23&rIn the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash
Book9Page45=Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. &l6&rAnd he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the
Book6Page20=they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem\: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. &l20&rAnd they brought him on horses\: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. &l21&rAnd all the
Book9Page44=Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. &l5&rAnd he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about
Book9Page43=Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven\: and he burned them without
Book9Page42=LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. &l4&rAnd the king commanded
Book9Page41=prophets, and all the people, both small and great\: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. &l3&rAnd the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the
Book2Page29=Chapter 5\nNow Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria\: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper. &l2&rAnd the Syrians had gone
Book9Page40=Chapter 23\nAnd the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. &l2&rAnd the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the
Book2Page28=eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.
Book2Page27=that they may eat. &l43&rAnd his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat\: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. &l44&rSo he set it before them, and they did
Book2Page26=that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. &l42&rAnd there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people,
Book2Page25=to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. &l41&rBut he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people,
Book2Page24=&l39&rAnd one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage\: for they knew them not. &l40&rSo they poured out for the men to eat. And it came
Book2Page23=her son, and went out. &l38&rAnd Elisha came again to Gilgal\: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him\: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
Book2Page22=the child opened his eyes. &l36&rAnd he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. &l37&rThen she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up
Book2Page21=and his hands upon his hands\: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. &l35&rThen he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him\: and the child sneezed seven times, and
Book2Page20=house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. &l33&rHe went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. &l34&rAnd he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes,
Book6Page19=&l17&rAnd Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. &l18&rAnd the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l19&rNow
Book6Page18=fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? &l16&rAnd Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
Book6Page17=took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria. &l15&rNow the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he
Book6Page16=&l13&rAnd Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. &l14&rAnd he
Book6Page15=not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah. &l12&rAnd Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
Book9Page39=I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
Book6Page14=trode down the thistle. &l10&rThou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up\: glory of this, and tarry at home\: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? &l11&rBut Amaziah would
Book9Page38=LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD. &l20&rBehold therefore,

Book6Page12=Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day. &l8&rThen Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the
Book9Page36=Judah hath read\: &l17&rBecause they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.

Book2Page17=LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. &l28&rThen she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? &l29&rThen he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way\: if thou meet any man,
Book2Page16=well with the child? And she answered, It is well. &l27&rAnd when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet\: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her\: and the

Book1Page46=and upward, and stood in the border. &l22&rAnd they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood\: &l23&rAnd they said, This is blood\: the kings are surely slain, and they
Book1Page45=meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. &l21&rAnd when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour,
Book1Page44=Moabites also into your hand. &l19&rAnd ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. &l20&rAnd it came to pass in the morning, when the
Book1Page43=saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. &l18&rAnd this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD\: he will deliver the
Book1Page42=I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. &l15&rBut now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. &l16&rAnd he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. &l17&rFor thus
Book1Page41=him, Nay\: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. &l14&rAnd Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,
Book1Page40=king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. &l13&rAnd Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto
Book5Page39=Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David\: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
Book5Page38=they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l20&rAnd his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. &l21&rFor Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
Book5Page37=hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria\: and he went away from Jerusalem. &l19&rAnd the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are
Book5Page36=up, and fought against Gath, and took it\: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. &l18&rAnd Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own
Book5Page35=not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen\: for they dealt faithfully. &l16&rThe trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD\: it was the priests'. &l17&rThen Hazael king of Syria went
Book5Page34=of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD\: &l14&rBut they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. &l15&rMoreover they reckoned
Book5Page33=LORD, &l12&rAnd to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it. &l13&rHowbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls
Book5Page32=found in the house of the LORD. &l11&rAnd they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD\: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the
Book5Page31=door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. &l10&rAnd it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was
Book5Page30=of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house. &l9&rBut Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD\: and the priests that kept the
Book8Page50=shadow to go down ten degrees\: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. &l11&rAnd Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD\: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.
Book1Page39=the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. &l12&rAnd Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
Book1Page38=no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. &l10&rAnd the king of Israel said, Alas\! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab\! &l11&rBut Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of
Book1Page37=thy horses. &l8&rAnd he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom. &l9&rSo the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom\: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey\: and there was
Book1Page36=all Israel. &l7&rAnd he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me\: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up\: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as
Book1Page35=Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. &l5&rBut it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. &l6&rAnd king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered
Book1Page34=put away the image of Baal that his father had made. &l3&rNevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. &l4&rAnd Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of
Book1Page33=Chapter 3\nNow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. &l2&rAnd he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother\: for he
Book7Page9=sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar. &l14&rAnd he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
Book1Page32=thence he returned to Samaria.
Book7Page8=king Ahaz came from Damascus. &l12&rAnd when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar\: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon. &l13&rAnd he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and
Book1Page31=up, thou bald head. &l24&rAnd he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. &l25&rAnd he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from
Book7Page7=sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof. &l11&rAnd Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus\: so Urijah the priest made it against
Book1Page30=unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. &l23&rAnd he went up from thence unto Bethel\: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go
Book7Page6=for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin. &l10&rAnd king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus\: and king Ahaz
Book7Page5=Israel, which rise up against me. &l8&rAnd Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. &l9&rAnd the king of Assyria hearkened unto him\:
Book7Page4=Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day. &l7&rSo Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son\: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of
Book7Page3=&l5&rThen Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war\: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. &l6&rAt that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath\: and the
Book4Page50=vestments. &l23&rAnd Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.
Book7Page2=and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel. &l4&rAnd he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
Book7Page1=Chapter 16 Cont.\nTwenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father. &l3&rBut he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea,
Book5Page29=priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. &l8&rAnd the priests consented to receive no more money
Book5Page28=them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. &l6&rBut it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. &l7&rThen king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the
Book5Page27=even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD, &l5&rLet the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance\: and let
Book5Page26=priest instructed him. &l3&rBut the high places were not taken away\: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. &l4&rAnd Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
Book5Page25=Chapter 12\nIn the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba. &l2&rAnd Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the
Book8Page49=LORD the third day? &l9&rAnd Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken\: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? &l10&rAnd Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the
Book5Page24=sword beside the king's house. &l21&rSeven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
Book8Page48=servant David's sake. &l7&rAnd Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. &l8&rAnd Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the
Book5Page23=down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. &l20&rAnd all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet\: and they slew Athaliah with the
Book8Page47=thee\: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. &l6&rAnd I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my
Book5Page22=thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. &l19&rAnd he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought
Book8Page46=out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, &l5&rTurn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears\: behold, I will heal
Book5Page21=the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people. &l18&rAnd all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces
Book8Page45=prayed unto the LORD, saying, &l3&rI beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. &l4&rAnd it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone
Book5Page20=sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. &l16&rAnd they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house\: and there was she slain. &l17&rAnd Jehoiada made a covenant between
Book8Page44=Chapter 20\nIn those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. &l2&rThen he turned his face to the wall, and
Book8Page43=Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword\: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
Book8Page42=when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. &l36&rSo Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. &l37&rAnd it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that
Book8Page41=&l34&rFor I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. &l35&rAnd it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand\: and
Book8Page40=king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. &l33&rBy the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
Book1Page29=brought it to him. &l21&rAnd he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. &l22&rSo the waters were healed
Book1Page28=Go not? &l19&rAnd the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth\: but the water is naught, and the ground barren. &l20&rAnd he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
Book1Page27=&l17&rAnd when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. &l18&rAnd when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you,
Book1Page26=&l16&rAnd they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master\: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
Book4Page49=man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another. &l22&rAnd he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth
Book1Page25=parted hither and thither\: and Elisha went over. &l15&rAnd when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
Book4Page48=subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. &l20&rAnd Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it. &l21&rAnd Jehu sent through all Israel\: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a
Book1Page24=mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; &l14&rAnd he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they
Book4Page47=shall serve him much. &l19&rNow therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting\: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in
Book1Page23=a whirlwind into heaven. &l12&rAnd Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more\: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. &l13&rHe took up also the
Book4Page46=Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah. &l18&rAnd Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu
Book1Page22=taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by
Book4Page45=Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. &l16&rAnd he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot. &l17&rAnd when he came to
Book1Page21=Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. &l10&rAnd he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing\: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am
Book4Page44=house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them. &l15&rAnd when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him\: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And
Book1Page20=and they two stood by Jordan. &l8&rAnd Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. &l9&rAnd it came to pass, when they were gone over, that
Book4Page43=said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen. &l14&rAnd he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing
Book4Page42=all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. &l12&rAnd he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way, &l13&rJehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and
Book4Page41=there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab\: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah. &l11&rSo Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and
Book4Page40=entering in of the gate until the morning. &l9&rAnd it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous\: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him\: but who slew all these? &l10&rKnow now that
Book5Page19=and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. &l15&rBut Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges\: and him that followeth her kill with the
Book5Page18=people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. &l14&rAnd when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets\:
Book5Page17=brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. &l13&rAnd when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
Book5Page16=shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. &l11&rAnd the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. &l12&rAnd he
Book8Page39=Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. &l31&rFor out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion\: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this. &l32&rTherefore thus saith the LORD concerning the
Book5Page15=priest commanded\: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. &l10&rAnd to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and
Book8Page38=shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof. &l30&rAnd the remnant that is escaped of the house of
Book5Page14=round about, every man with his weapons in his hand\: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain\: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. &l9&rAnd the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the
Book8Page37=me. &l28&rBecause thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. &l29&rAnd this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye
Book5Page13=behind the guard\: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. &l7&rAnd two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. &l8&rAnd ye shall compass the king
Book8Page36=they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. &l27&rBut I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against
Book5Page12=&l5&rAnd he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; &l6&rAnd a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate
Book8Page35=&l25&rHast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps. &l26&rTherefore their inhabitants were of small power,
Book5Page11=Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.
Book8Page34=and the choice fir trees thereof\: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel. &l24&rI have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
Book5Page10=sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. &l3&rAnd he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land. &l4&rAnd the seventh year
Book8Page33=against the Holy One of Israel. &l23&rBy thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof,
Book8Page32=the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. &l22&rWhom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even
Book8Page31=&l20&rThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. &l21&rThis is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin
Book1Page19=unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. &l7&rAnd fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off\:
Book8Page30=but the work of men's hands, wood and stone\: therefore they have destroyed them. &l19&rNow therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.
Book1Page18=came to Jericho. &l5&rAnd the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. &l6&rAnd Elijah said
Book1Page17=thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace. &l4&rAnd Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
Book1Page16=him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel. &l3&rAnd the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from
Book4Page39=king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel. &l8&rAnd there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the
Book1Page15=Chapter 2\nAnd it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. &l2&rAnd Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto
Book4Page38=the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up. &l7&rAnd it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the
Book1Page14=son. &l18&rNow the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
Book4Page37=servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king\: do thou that which is good in thine eyes. &l6&rThen he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of
Book1Page13=that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. &l17&rSo he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no
Book4Page36=exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him\: how then shall we stand? &l5&rAnd he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy
Book1Page12=him unto the king. &l16&rAnd he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off
Book4Page35=master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; &l3&rLook even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. &l4&rBut they were
Book1Page11=heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties\: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. &l15&rAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him\: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with
Book4Page34=Chapter 10\nAnd Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying, &l2&rNow as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your
Book1Page10=captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. &l14&rBehold, there came fire down from
Book4Page33=Jezebel\: &l37&rAnd the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
Book4Page32=skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. &l36&rWherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of
Book4Page31=the horses\: and he trode her under foot. &l34&rAnd when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her\: for she is a king's daughter. &l35&rAnd they went to bury her\: but they found no more of her than the
Book4Page30=master? &l32&rAnd he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. &l33&rAnd he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down\: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on
Book7Page50=took them.
Book8Page29=eyes, and see\: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. &l17&rOf a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, &l18&rAnd have cast their gods into the fire\: for they were no gods,
Book8Page28=prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. &l16&rLORD, bow down thine ear, and hear\: open, LORD, thine
Book8Page27=of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? &l14&rAnd Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it\: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. &l15&rAnd Hezekiah
Book8Page26=them utterly\: and shalt thou be delivered? &l12&rHave the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar? &l13&rWhere is the king of Hamath, and the king
Book8Page25=Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. &l11&rBehold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying
Book8Page24=warring against Libnah\: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. &l9&rAnd when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee\: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, &l10&rThus shall ye speak to
Book8Page23=Assyria have blasphemed me. &l7&rBehold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. &l8&rSo Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria
Book8Page22=remnant that are left. &l5&rSo the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. &l6&rAnd Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of
Book8Page21=bring forth. &l4&rIt may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard\: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
Book8Page20=the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. &l3&rAnd they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy\: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to
Book4Page29=began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. &l30&rAnd when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window. &l31&rAnd as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his
Book4Page28=Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. &l28&rAnd his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. &l29&rAnd in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab
Book4Page27=into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD. &l27&rBut when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to
Book4Page26=together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; &l26&rSurely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him
Book4Page25=between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. &l25&rThen said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite\: for remember how that, when I and thou rode
Book7Page49=transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them. &l13&rNow in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and
Book4Page24=peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many? &l23&rAnd Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. &l24&rAnd Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
Book7Page48=Israel, Samaria was taken. &l11&rAnd the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes\: &l12&rBecause they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
Book4Page23=Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. &l22&rAnd it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What
Book7Page47=seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. &l10&rAnd at the end of three years they took it\: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of
Book4Page22=&l20&rAnd the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again\: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. &l21&rAnd Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of
Book7Page46=rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. &l8&rHe smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. &l9&rAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the
Book4Page21=told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. &l19&rThen he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
Book7Page45=Judah, nor any that were before him. &l6&rFor he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses. &l7&rAnd the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth\: and he
Book4Page20=said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace? &l18&rSo there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman
Book7Page44=and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made\: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it\: and he called it Nehushtan. &l5&rHe trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of
Book7Page43=Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. &l3&rAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did. &l4&rHe removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves,
Book7Page42=Chapter 18\nNow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. &l2&rTwenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in
Book7Page41=they unto this day.
Book7Page40=hand of all your enemies. &l40&rHowbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. &l41&rSo these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children\: as did their fathers, so do
Book8Page19=Chapter 19\nAnd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. &l2&rAnd he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of
Book8Page18=household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Book6Page9=Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. &l3&rAnd he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father\: he did according to all things as Joash his father did. &l4&rHowbeit the high places were not taken away\: as yet the people did sacrifice
Book8Page17=hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? &l36&rBut the people held their peace, and answered him not a word\: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. &l37&rThen came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
Book6Page8=Chapter 14\nIn the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah. &l2&rHe was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
Book8Page16=Assyria? &l34&rWhere are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? &l35&rWho are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine
Book6Page7=Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
Book8Page15=land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die\: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. &l33&rHath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of
Book6Page6=yet. &l24&rSo Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead. &l25&rAnd Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.
Book8Page14=to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern\: &l32&rUntil I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a
Book6Page5=Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. &l23&rAnd the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as
Book8Page13=trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. &l31&rHearken not to Hezekiah\: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out
Book6Page4=were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha\: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. &l22&rBut Hazael king of Syria oppressed
Book8Page12=voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria\: &l29&rThus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you\: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand\: &l30&rNeither let Hezekiah make you
Book6Page3=hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it\: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice. &l20&rAnd Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. &l21&rAnd it came to pass, as they
Book8Page11=unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you? &l28&rThen Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud
Book6Page2=&l18&rAnd he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. &l19&rAnd the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then
Book6Page1=Chapter 13 Cont.\nAnd he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria\: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
Book8Page10=the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it\: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall. &l27&rBut Rabshakeh said
Book4Page19=rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. &l17&rAnd there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram
Book4Page18=was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel. &l16&rSo Jehu
Book4Page17=the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king. &l14&rSo Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. &l15&rBut king Joram
Book4Page16=his communication. &l12&rAnd they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. &l13&rThen they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on
Book7Page39=ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods. &l38&rAnd the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods. &l39&rBut the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the
Book4Page15=Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled. &l11&rThen Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord\: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and
Book7Page38=you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice. &l37&rAnd the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you,
Book4Page14=pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel\: &l9&rAnd I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah\: &l10&rAnd the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of

Book4Page13=shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. &l8&rFor the whole house of Ahab shall perish\: and I will cut off from Ahab him that
Book7Page36=manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence. &l34&rUnto this day they do after the former manners\: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
Book4Page12=us? And he said, To thee, O captain. &l6&rAnd he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel. &l7&rAnd thou
Book7Page35=the gods of Sepharvaim. &l32&rSo they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. &l33&rThey feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
Book4Page11=and flee, and tarry not. &l4&rSo the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead. &l5&rAnd when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all
Book7Page34=they dwelt. &l30&rAnd the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, &l31&rAnd the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,
Book4Page10=the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; &l3&rThen take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door,
Book7Page33=away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. &l29&rHowbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein
Book7Page32=&l27&rThen the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. &l28&rThen one of the priests whom they had carried
Book7Page31=&l26&rWherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land\: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
Book7Page30=children of Israel\: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. &l25&rAnd so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD\: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
Book7Page29=was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day. &l24&rAnd the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
Book7Page28=LORD, and made them sin a great sin. &l22&rFor the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; &l23&rUntil the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So
Book7Page27=Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. &l21&rFor he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king\: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the
Book7Page26=Israel, and removed them out of his sight\: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. &l19&rAlso Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. &l20&rAnd the LORD rejected all the seed of
Book7Page25=Baal. &l17&rAnd they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. &l18&rTherefore the LORD was very angry with
Book7Page24=concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them. &l16&rAnd they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
Book7Page23=their God. &l15&rAnd they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them,
Book7Page22=statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets. &l14&rNotwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD
Book7Page21=idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing. &l13&rYet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my
Book7Page20=groves in every high hill, and under every green tree\: &l11&rAnd there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger\: &l12&rFor they served
Book10Page50=Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
Book7Page19=made. &l9&rAnd the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. &l10&rAnd they set them up images and
Book7Page18=up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, &l8&rAnd walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had
Book7Page17=took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. &l7&rFor so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them
Book7Page16=done year by year\: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. &l5&rThen the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. &l6&rIn the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria
Book7Page15=him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents. &l4&rAnd the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea\: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had
Book7Page14=Chapter 17\nIn the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. &l2&rAnd he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him. &l3&rAgainst
Book7Page13=in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? &l20&rAnd Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David\: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
Book7Page12=pavement of stones. &l18&rAnd the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria. &l19&rNow the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written
Book7Page11=&l16&rThus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. &l17&rAnd king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a
Book7Page10=&l15&rAnd king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice\: and the brasen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
Book10Page49=people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. &l23&rAnd when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of
Book10Page48=Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah\: &l21&rAnd the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land. &l22&rAnd as for the
Book10Page47=war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city\: &l20&rAnd
Book10Page46=these had the second pillar with wreathen work. &l18&rAnd the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door\: &l19&rAnd out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of
Book10Page45=was without weight. &l17&rThe height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass\: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass\: and like unto

Book5Page6=God of Israel with all his heart\: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin. &l32&rIn those days the LORD began to cut Israel short\: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel; &l33&rFrom Jordan eastward, all the land
Book5Page5=executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. &l31&rBut Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD

Book10Page38=king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho\: and all his army were scattered from him. &l6&rSo they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. &l7&rAnd they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his

Book10Page30=in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. &l14&rAnd he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths\: none remained, save the poorest sort of the

Book10Page24=his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did; &l4&rAnd also for the innocent blood that he shed\: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon. &l5&rNow the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he

Book10Page11=put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. &l25&rAnd like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his
Book10Page10=Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem. &l24&rMoreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah

Book3Page48=sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. &l13&rAnd Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria. &l14&rSo he
Book3Page47=was ashamed\: and the man of God wept. &l12&rAnd Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel\: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the
