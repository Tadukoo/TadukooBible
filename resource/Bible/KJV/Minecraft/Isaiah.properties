Book16Page15=waste cities, the desolations of many generations. &l5&rAnd strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers. &l6&rBut ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD\: men shall call you the
Book11Page29=but he heareth not. &l21&rThe LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable. &l22&rBut this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses\: they
Book16Page14=praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. &l4&rAnd they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the
Book11Page28=deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. &l19&rWho is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant? &l20&rSeeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
Book16Page13=are bound; &l2&rTo proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; &l3&rTo appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
Book11Page27=before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. &l17&rThey shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods. &l18&rHear, ye
Book16Page12=Chapter 61\n &l1&rThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that
Book11Page26=mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. &l16&rAnd I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known\: I will make darkness light
Book16Page11=land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. &l22&rA little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation\: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.
Book11Page25=a man of war\: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. &l14&rI have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself\: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once. &l15&rI will make waste
Book16Page10=God thy glory. &l20&rThy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself\: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. &l21&rThy people also shall be all righteous\: they shall inherit the
Book11Page24=doth inhabit\: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. &l12&rLet them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands. &l13&rThe LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like
Book11Page23=unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. &l11&rLet the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar
Book11Page22=house. &l8&rI am the LORD\: that is my name\: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. &l9&rBehold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare\: before they spring forth I tell you of them. &l10&rSing
Book11Page21=righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; &l7&rTo open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison
Book11Page20=God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein\: &l6&rI the LORD have called thee in
Book11Page19=bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench\: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. &l4&rHe shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth\: and the isles shall wait for his law. &l5&rThus saith
Book11Page18=Chapter 42\nBehold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him\: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. &l2&rHe shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. &l3&rA
Book11Page17=no counseller, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word. &l29&rBehold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing\: their molten images are wind and confusion.
Book11Page16=none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words. &l27&rThe first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them\: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. &l28&rFor I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was
Book11Page15=upon my name\: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay. &l26&rWho hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is
Book11Page14=evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together. &l24&rBehold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought\: an abomination is he that chooseth you. &l25&rI have raised up one from the north, and he shall come\: from the rising of the sun shall he call
Book11Page13=happen\: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come. &l23&rShew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods\: yea, do good, or do
Book11Page12=together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it. &l21&rProduce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob. &l22&rLet them bring them forth, and shew us what shall
Book11Page11=water. &l19&rI will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together\: &l20&rThat they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
Book11Page10=tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. &l18&rI will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys\: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of
Book14Page9=that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up. &l19&rThese two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword\: by whom shall I comfort thee? &l20&rThy sons have
Book14Page8=up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out. &l18&rThere is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any
Book14Page7=LORD of hosts is his name. &l16&rAnd I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. &l17&rAwake, awake, stand
Book14Page6=destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? &l14&rThe captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. &l15&rBut I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared\: The
Book14Page5=of man which shall be made as grass; &l13&rAnd forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to
Book14Page4=Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head\: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. &l12&rI, even I, am he that comforteth you\: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son
Book14Page3=wounded the dragon? &l10&rArt thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? &l11&rTherefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto
Book14Page2=like wool\: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. &l9&rAwake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and
Book14Page1=Chapter 51 Cont.\nHearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. &l8&rFor the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them
Book2Page50=whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.
Book4Page9=will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. &l12&rI will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. &l13&rTherefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD
Book4Page8=give their light\: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. &l11&rAnd I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and
Book4Page7=faces shall be as flames. &l9&rBehold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate\: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. &l10&rFor the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not
Book4Page6=Almighty. &l7&rTherefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt\: &l8&rAnd they shall be afraid\: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth\: they shall be amazed one at another; their
Book2Page49=fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. &l16&rBind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. &l17&rAnd I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. &l18&rBehold, I and the children
Book4Page5=the host of the battle. &l5&rThey come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. &l6&rHowl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the
Book15Page50=thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come\: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.
Book2Page48=and let him be your dread. &l14&rAnd he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. &l15&rAnd many among them shall stumble, and
Book4Page4=have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. &l4&rThe noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together\: the LORD of hosts mustereth
Book2Page47=I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, &l12&rSay ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. &l13&rSanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
Book4Page3=Chapter 13\nThe burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. &l2&rLift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. &l3&rI have commanded my sanctified ones, I
Book2Page46=pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. &l10&rTake counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand\: for God is with us. &l11&rFor the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that
Book4Page2=&l6&rCry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion\: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
Book2Page45=to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. &l9&rAssociate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries\: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in
Book4Page1=Chapter 12 Cont.\nAnd in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. &l5&rSing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things\: this is known in all the earth.
Book2Page44=upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory\: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks\: &l8&rAnd he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even
Book2Page43=taken away before the king of Assyria. &l5&rThe LORD spake also unto me again, saying, &l6&rForasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; &l7&rNow therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up
Book2Page42=unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz. &l4&rFor before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be
Book2Page41=Chapter 8\nMoreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. &l2&rAnd I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. &l3&rAnd I went
Book2Page40=and thorns\: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
Book15Page49=at thy side. &l5&rThen thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. &l6&rThe multitude of camels shall cover
Book15Page48=&l3&rAnd the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. &l4&rLift up thine eyes round about, and see\: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee\: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed
Book15Page47=Chapter 60\nArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. &l2&rFor, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people\: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
Book15Page46=out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.
Book15Page45=from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. &l21&rAs for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
Book15Page44=fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. &l20&rAnd the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
Book15Page43=put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. &l18&rAccording to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. &l19&rSo shall they
Book15Page42=that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor\: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. &l17&rFor he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he
Book15Page41=justice standeth afar off\: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. &l15&rYea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey\: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. &l16&rAnd he saw
Book2Page39=shall even be for briers and thorns. &l24&rWith arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns. &l25&rAnd on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers
Book15Page40=our iniquities, we know them; &l13&rIn transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. &l14&rAnd judgment is turned away backward, and
Book2Page38=of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter\: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land. &l23&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it
Book2Page37=the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet\: and it shall also consume the beard. &l21&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; &l22&rAnd it shall come to pass, for the abundance
Book2Page36=Assyria. &l19&rAnd they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. &l20&rIn the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired, namely, by them beyond
Book2Page35=come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria. &l18&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of
Book2Page34=&l16&rFor before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. &l17&rThe LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not
Book2Page33=weary my God also? &l14&rTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. &l15&rButter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
Book2Page32=thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. &l12&rBut Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. &l13&rAnd he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye
Book2Page31=Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. &l9&rAnd the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established. &l10&rMoreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, &l11&rAsk
Book2Page30=set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal\: &l7&rThus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. &l8&rFor the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall
Book15Page39=bears, and mourn sore like doves\: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. &l12&rFor our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us\: for our transgressions are with us; and as for
Book15Page38=for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. &l10&rWe grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes\: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men. &l11&rWe roar all like
Book15Page37=their paths. &l8&rThe way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings\: they have made them crooked paths\: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace. &l9&rTherefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us\: we wait
Book15Page36=themselves with their works\: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. &l7&rTheir feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood\: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in
Book15Page35=mischief, and bring forth iniquity. &l5&rThey hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web\: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. &l6&rTheir webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
Book15Page34=&l3&rFor your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. &l4&rNone calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth\: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive
Book15Page33=Chapter 59\nBehold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear\: &l2&rBut your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
Book15Page32=nor speaking thine own words\: &l14&rThen shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father\: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
Book15Page31=paths to dwell in. &l13&rIf thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure,
Book2Page29=the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. &l5&rBecause Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, &l6&rLet us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and
Book15Page30=garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. &l12&rAnd they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places\: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of
Book2Page28=meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; &l4&rAnd say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for
Book2Page27=against it. &l2&rAnd it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. &l3&rThen said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to
Book2Page26=Chapter 7\n &l1&rAnd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail
Book2Page25=oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves\: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
Book2Page24=without man, and the land be utterly desolate, &l12&rAnd the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. &l13&rBut yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten\: as a teil tree, and as an
Book2Page23=and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. &l11&rThen said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses
Book2Page22=shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. &l9&rAnd he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. &l10&rMake the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
Book2Page21=coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar\: &l7&rAnd he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. &l8&rAlso I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom
Book2Page20=smoke. &l5&rThen said I, Woe is me\! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips\: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. &l6&rThen flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live
Book15Page29=hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday\: &l11&rAnd the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones\: and thou shalt be like a watered
Book15Page28=rereward. &l9&rThen shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; &l10&rAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the
Book15Page27=thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? &l8&rThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily\: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
Book15Page26=bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? &l7&rIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that
Book15Page25=chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? &l6&rIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the
Book15Page24=of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. &l4&rBehold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness\: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. &l5&rIs it such a fast that I have
Book15Page23=ordinance of their God\: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. &l3&rWherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day
Book15Page22=Chapter 58\nCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. &l2&rYet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the
Book15Page21=and dirt. &l21&rThere is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
Book2Page19=his feet, and with twain he did fly. &l3&rAnd one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts\: the whole earth is full of his glory. &l4&rAnd the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with
Book15Page20=him and to his mourners. &l19&rI create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him. &l20&rBut the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire
Book2Page18=Chapter 6\nIn the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. &l2&rAbove it stood the seraphims\: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered
Book2Page17=darkened in the heavens thereof.
Book15Page9=Chapter 57\nThe righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart\: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. &l2&rHe shall enter into peace\: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in
Book2Page16=they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it. &l30&rAnd in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea\: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is

Book2Page15=latchet of their shoes be broken\: &l28&rWhose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind\: &l29&rTheir roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions\: yea,
Book15Page7=&l10&rHis watchmen are blind\: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. &l11&rYea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand\: they all
Book2Page14=nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth\: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly\: &l27&rNone shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the
Book15Page6=of prayer for all people. &l8&rThe Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him. &l9&rAll ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.
Book2Page13=his hand against them, and hath smitten them\: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. &l26&rAnd he will lift up an ensign to the
Book15Page5=polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; &l7&rEven them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer\: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house
Book2Page12=rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust\: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. &l25&rTherefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth
Book15Page4=daughters\: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. &l6&rAlso the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from
Book2Page11=strength to mingle strong drink\: &l23&rWhich justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him\! &l24&rTherefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as
Book15Page3=&l4&rFor thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; &l5&rEven unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of
Book2Page10=that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter\! &l21&rWoe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight\! &l22&rWoe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of
Book15Page2=polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. &l3&rNeither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people\: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
Book15Page1=Chapter 56\nThus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice\: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. &l2&rBlessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from
Book15Page19=I have made. &l17&rFor the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him\: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. &l18&rI have seen his ways, and will heal him\: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto
Book15Page18=also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. &l16&rFor I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth\: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which
Book15Page17=&l14&rAnd shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people. &l15&rFor thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him
Book15Page16=works; for they shall not profit thee. &l13&rWhen thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them\: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;
Book15Page15=wast not grieved. &l11&rAnd of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not? &l12&rI will declare thy righteousness, and thy
Book15Page14=didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell. &l10&rThou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope\: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou
Book15Page13=set up thy remembrance\: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. &l9&rAnd thou wentest to the king with ointment, and
Book15Page12=poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these? &l7&rUpon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed\: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. &l8&rBehind the doors also and the posts hast thou
Book15Page11=seed of falsehood, &l5&rEnflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks? &l6&rAmong the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot\: even to them hast thou
Book15Page10=his uprightness. &l3&rBut draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore. &l4&rAgainst whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a
Book5Page9=shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind. &l14&rAnd behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and
Book5Page8=multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters\! &l13&rThe nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters\: but God shall rebuke them, and they
Book5Page7=pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips\: &l11&rIn the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish\: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow. &l12&rWoe to the
Book5Page6=and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel\: and there shall be desolation. &l10&rBecause thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant
Book5Page5=respect to the Holy One of Israel. &l8&rAnd he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images. &l9&rIn that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
Book5Page4=it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel. &l7&rAt that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have
Book5Page3=and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean. &l5&rAnd it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim. &l6&rYet gleaning grapes shall be left in
Book5Page2=also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria\: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts. &l4&rAnd in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin,
Book5Page1=Chapter 17\nThe burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. &l2&rThe cities of Aroer are forsaken\: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid. &l3&rThe fortress
Book6Page50=the LORD. &l11&rLORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see\: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
Book6Page49=when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. &l10&rLet favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness\: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of
Book6Page48=&l8&rYea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. &l9&rWith my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early\: for
Book6Page47=it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. &l6&rThe foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. &l7&rThe way of the just is uprightness\: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
Book6Page46=in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee\: because he trusteth in thee. &l4&rTrust ye in the LORD for ever\: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength\: &l5&rFor he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth
Book6Page45=Chapter 26\nIn that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. &l2&rOpen ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. &l3&rThou wilt keep him
Book6Page44=their pride together with the spoils of their hands. &l12&rAnd the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.
Book6Page43=hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. &l11&rAnd he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim\: and he shall bring down
Book6Page42=the LORD hath spoken it. &l9&rAnd it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us\: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. &l10&rFor in this mountain shall the
Book6Page41=the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. &l8&rHe will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth\: for
Book6Page40=brought low. &l6&rAnd in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. &l7&rAnd he will destroy in this mountain the face of
Book6Page39=a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. &l5&rThou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud\: the branch of the terrible ones shall be
Book6Page38=to be no city; it shall never be built. &l3&rTherefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. &l4&rFor thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm,
Book6Page37=Chapter 25\nO LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. &l2&rFor thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin\: a palace of strangers
Book6Page36=gloriously.
Book6Page35=gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. &l23&rThen the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients
Book6Page34=shall fall, and not rise again. &l21&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. &l22&rAnd they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are
Book6Page33=&l19&rThe earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. &l20&rThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it
Book6Page32=shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare\: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
Book6Page31=But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me\! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. &l17&rFear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. &l18&rAnd it
Book6Page30=of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea. &l15&rWherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea. &l16&rFrom the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous.
Book16Page9=within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. &l19&rThe sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee\: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy
Book16Page8=&l17&rFor brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron\: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. &l18&rViolence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction
Book16Page7=will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. &l16&rThou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings\: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
Book16Page6=and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. &l15&rWhereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I
Book16Page5=glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious. &l14&rThe sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee;
Book16Page4=shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. &l12&rFor the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. &l13&rThe
Book16Page3=he hath glorified thee. &l10&rAnd the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee\: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee. &l11&rTherefore thy gates shall be open continually; they
Book16Page2=cloud, and as the doves to their windows? &l9&rSurely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because
Book16Page1=Chapter 60 Cont.\nAll the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee\: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. &l8&rWho are these that fly as a
Book6Page29=destruction. &l13&rWhen thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done. &l14&rThey shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty
Book6Page28=of confusion is broken down\: every house is shut up, that no man may come in. &l11&rThere is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. &l12&rIn the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
Book6Page27=languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh. &l8&rThe mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. &l9&rThey shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. &l10&rThe city
Book6Page26=changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. &l6&rTherefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate\: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. &l7&rThe new wine mourneth, the vine
Book6Page25=hath spoken this word. &l4&rThe earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. &l5&rThe earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws,
Book6Page24=with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. &l3&rThe land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled\: for the LORD
Book6Page23=Chapter 24\nBehold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. &l2&rAnd it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as
Book6Page22=for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
Book6Page21=shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. &l18&rAnd her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD\: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be
Book6Page20=harlot. &l16&rTake an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. &l17&rAnd it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she

Book6Page9=David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. &l23&rAnd I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house. &l24&rAnd they shall hang
Book6Page8=Hilkiah\: &l21&rAnd I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand\: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. &l22&rAnd the key of the house of
Book6Page7=there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house. &l19&rAnd I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down. &l20&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of
Book6Page6=graveth an habitation for himself in a rock? &l17&rBehold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee. &l18&rHe will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country\: there shalt thou die, and
Book6Page5=GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say, &l16&rWhat hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that
Book6Page4=flesh, and drinking wine\: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die. &l14&rAnd it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. &l15&rThus saith the Lord
Book6Page3=had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago. &l12&rAnd in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth\: &l13&rAnd behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating
Book6Page2=lower pool. &l10&rAnd ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall. &l11&rYe made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool\: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither

Book6Page18=Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest. &l13&rBehold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness\: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought
Book6Page17=his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms\: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof. &l12&rAnd he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon\: arise, pass over to
Book6Page16=earth? &l9&rThe LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth. &l10&rPass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish\: there is no more strength. &l11&rHe stretched out
Book6Page15=&l7&rIs this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn. &l8&rWho hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the

Book10Page45=take root in the earth\: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble. &l25&rTo whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. &l26&rLift up your eyes on high, and behold
Book10Page44=the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in\: &l23&rThat bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. &l24&rYea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown\: yea, their stock shall not

Book10Page35=goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field\: &l7&rThe grass withereth, the flower fadeth\: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it\: surely the people is grass. &l8&rThe grass withereth, the flower fadeth\: but the word of our God shall stand for

Book10Page28=Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon. &l4&rThen said he, What have they seen in thine house? And
Book10Page27=things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures\: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. &l3&rThen came
Book10Page26=Chapter 39\nAt that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah\: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered. &l2&rAnd Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious
Book10Page25=house of the LORD. &l21&rFor Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover. &l22&rHezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
Book10Page24=&l19&rThe living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day\: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. &l20&rThe LORD was ready to save me\: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the
Book10Page23=but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption\: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. &l18&rFor the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee\: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
Book10Page22=done it\: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. &l16&rO Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit\: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. &l17&rBehold, for peace I had great bitterness\:
Book10Page21=night wilt thou make an end of me. &l14&rLike a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter\: I did mourn as a dove\: mine eyes fail with looking upward\: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me. &l15&rWhat shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath
Book10Page20=from me as a shepherd's tent\: I have cut off like a weaver my life\: he will cut me off with pining sickness\: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. &l13&rI reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones\: from day even to
Book17Page9=heavens and a new earth\: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. &l18&rBut be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create\: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. &l19&rAnd I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
Book17Page8=blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. &l17&rFor, behold, I create new
Book17Page7=for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. &l15&rAnd ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen\: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name\: &l16&rThat he who
Book17Page6=not. &l13&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry\: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty\: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed\: &l14&rBehold, my servants shall sing
Book17Page5=unto that number. &l12&rTherefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter\: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted
Book17Page4=flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. &l11&rBut ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering
Book17Page3=servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all. &l9&rAnd I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains\: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. &l10&rAnd Sharon shall be a fold of
Book17Page2=mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills\: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom. &l8&rThus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it\: so will I do for my
Book17Page1=Chapter 65 Cont.\nBehold, it is written before me\: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, &l7&rYour iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the
Book10Page19=the gates of the grave\: I am deprived of the residue of my years. &l11&rI said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living\: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. &l12&rMine age is departed, and is removed
Book10Page18=Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. &l9&rThe writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness\: &l10&rI said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to
Book10Page17=the king of Assyria\: and I will defend this city. &l7&rAnd this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken; &l8&rBehold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of
Book10Page16=to Isaiah, saying, &l5&rGo, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears\: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. &l6&rAnd I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of
Book10Page15=wall, and prayed unto the LORD, &l3&rAnd said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. &l4&rThen came the word of the LORD
Book10Page14=Chapter 38\nIn those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order\: for thou shalt die, and not live. &l2&rThen Hezekiah turned his face toward the
Book10Page13=escaped into the land of Armenia\: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
Book10Page12=corpses. &l37&rSo Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. &l38&rAnd it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they
Book10Page11=it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. &l36&rThen the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand\: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead
Book10Page10=into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. &l34&rBy the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. &l35&rFor I will defend this city to save
Book7Page9=wine. &l3&rI the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment\: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day. &l4&rFury is not in me\: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.
Book7Page8=Chapter 27\nIn that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. &l2&rIn that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red
Book7Page7=shall no more cover her slain.
Book7Page6=doors about thee\: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. &l21&rFor, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity\: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and
Book7Page5=&l19&rThy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust\: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. &l20&rCome, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
Book7Page4=out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD. &l18&rWe have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
Book7Page3=removed it far unto all the ends of the earth. &l16&rLORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them. &l17&rLike as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth
Book7Page2=shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise\: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish. &l15&rThou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation\: thou art glorified\: thou hadst
Book7Page1=Chapter 26 Cont.\nLORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us\: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. &l13&rO LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us\: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. &l14&rThey are dead, they

Book14Page50=be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
Book1Page48=Chapter 5\nNow will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill\: &l2&rAnd he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a

Book1Page46=create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night\: for upon all the glory shall be a defence. &l6&rAnd there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from
Book1Page45=among the living in Jerusalem\: &l4&rWhen the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. &l5&rAnd the LORD will
Book1Page44=glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. &l3&rAnd it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written
Book1Page43=Chapter 4\nAnd in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel\: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach. &l2&rIn that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
Book1Page42=baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. &l25&rThy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. &l26&rAnd her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
Book1Page41=and the wimples, and the crisping pins, &l23&rThe glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. &l24&rAnd it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair
Book1Page40=moon, &l19&rThe chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, &l20&rThe bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, &l21&rThe rings, and nose jewels, &l22&rThe changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles,
Book14Page49=peace\: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. &l13&rInstead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree\: and it shall
Book14Page48=eater\: &l11&rSo shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth\: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. &l12&rFor ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with
Book14Page47=than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. &l10&rFor as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the
Book14Page46=the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. &l8&rFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. &l9&rFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
Book14Page45=the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee. &l6&rSeek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near\: &l7&rLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts\: and let him return unto
Book14Page44=you, even the sure mercies of David. &l4&rBehold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people. &l5&rBehold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of
Book14Page43=for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. &l3&rIncline your ear, and come unto me\: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with
Book14Page42=Chapter 55\nHo, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. &l2&rWherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour
Book14Page41=against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Book1Page39=with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. &l18&rIn that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the
Book14Page40=gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. &l16&rBehold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. &l17&rNo weapon that is formed
Book1Page38=Lord GOD of hosts. &l16&rMoreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet\: &l17&rTherefore the Lord will smite
Book1Page37=will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof\: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. &l15&rWhat mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the
Book1Page36=&l12&rAs for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. &l13&rThe LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. &l14&rThe LORD
Book1Page35=they have rewarded evil unto themselves. &l10&rSay ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him\: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. &l11&rWoe unto the wicked\! it shall be ill with him\: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
Book1Page34=and Judah is fallen\: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory. &l9&rThe shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul\! for
Book1Page33=Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand\: &l7&rIn that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing\: make me not a ruler of the people. &l8&rFor Jerusalem is ruined,
Book1Page32=shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour\: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. &l6&rWhen a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying,
Book1Page31=prudent, and the ancient, &l3&rThe captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counseller, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. &l4&rAnd I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. &l5&rAnd the people
Book1Page30=Chapter 3\nFor, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, &l2&rThe mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the
Book14Page39=thy children. &l14&rIn righteousness shalt thou be established\: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear\: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. &l15&rBehold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me\: whosoever shall
Book14Page38=fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. &l12&rAnd I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. &l13&rAnd all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of
Book14Page37=the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee. &l11&rO thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with
Book14Page36=LORD thy Redeemer. &l9&rFor this is as the waters of Noah unto me\: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. &l10&rFor the mountains shall depart, and
Book14Page35=when thou wast refused, saith thy God. &l7&rFor a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. &l8&rIn a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
Book14Page34=&l5&rFor thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called. &l6&rFor the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth,
Book14Page33=desolate cities to be inhabited. &l4&rFear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed\: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame\: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
Book14Page32=thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations\: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; &l3&rFor thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the
Book14Page31=Chapter 54\nSing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child\: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD. &l2&rEnlarge the place of
Book1Page29=the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. &l22&rCease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils\: for wherein is he to be accounted of?
Book14Page30=intercession for the transgressors.
Book1Page28=glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. &l20&rIn that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; &l21&rTo go into the clefts of
Book1Page27=haughtiness of men shall be made low\: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. &l18&rAnd the idols he shall utterly abolish. &l19&rAnd they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the
Book1Page26=mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, &l15&rAnd upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, &l16&rAnd upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. &l17&rAnd the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
Book1Page25=shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low\: &l13&rAnd upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, &l14&rAnd upon all the high
Book1Page24=thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty. &l11&rThe lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. &l12&rFor the day of the LORD of hosts
Book1Page23=&l8&rTheir land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made\: &l9&rAnd the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself\: therefore forgive them not. &l10&rEnter into the rock, and hide
Book1Page22=like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. &l7&rTheir land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots\:
Book1Page21=against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. &l5&rO house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. &l6&rTherefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
Book1Page20=shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. &l4&rAnd he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people\: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks\: nation shall not lift up sword
Book8Page9=bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit. &l15&rFor thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength\: and ye
Book8Page8=breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. &l14&rAnd he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare\: so that there shall not be found in the
Book8Page7=path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. &l12&rWherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon\: &l13&rTherefore this iniquity shall be to you as a
Book14Page29=iniquities. &l12&rTherefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death\: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
Book8Page6=children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD\: &l10&rWhich say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits\: &l11&rGet you out of the way, turn aside out of the
Book14Page28=shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. &l11&rHe shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied\: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their
Book8Page5=purpose\: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. &l8&rNow go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever\: &l9&rThat this is a rebellious people, lying
Book14Page27=his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. &l10&rYet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief\: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he
Book8Page4=old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them. &l7&rFor the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no
Book14Page26=her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. &l8&rHe was taken from prison and from judgment\: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living\: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. &l9&rAnd he made
Book8Page3=came to Hanes. &l5&rThey were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. &l6&rThe burden of the beasts of the south\: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and
Book14Page25=sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. &l7&rHe was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth\: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
Book8Page2=strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt\! &l3&rTherefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. &l4&rFor his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors
Book14Page24=sorrows\: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. &l5&rBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities\: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. &l6&rAll we like
Book8Page1=Chapter 30\nWoe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin\: &l2&rThat walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to
Book14Page23=that we should desire him. &l3&rHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief\: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. &l4&rSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
Book14Page22=Chapter 53\nWho hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? &l2&rFor he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground\: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty
Book14Page21=form more than the sons of men\: &l15&rSo shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him\: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
Book1Page19=hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. &l3&rAnd many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths\: for out of Zion
Book14Page20=will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward. &l13&rBehold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. &l14&rAs many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his
Book1Page18=Chapter 2\nThe word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. &l2&rAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the

Book1Page16=sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed. &l29&rFor they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. &l30&rFor ye shall be as an oak whose leaf

Book1Page11=saith the LORD\: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. &l19&rIf ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land\: &l20&rBut if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be

Book14Page13=Chapter 52\nAwake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city\: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. &l2&rShake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O

Book9Page48=prayed unto the LORD, saying, &l16&rO LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth\: thou hast made heaven and earth. &l17&rIncline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open
Book9Page47=of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? &l14&rAnd Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it\: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. &l15&rAnd Hezekiah
Ch59=B15P46
Book9Page46=them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? &l12&rHave the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar? &l13&rWhere is the king of Hamath, and the king
Ch58=B15P32
Book9Page45=to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. &l11&rBehold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying
Ch57=B15P21
Book9Page44=against Libnah\: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. &l9&rAnd he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, &l10&rThus shall ye speak
Ch56=B15P8
Book9Page43=Assyria have blasphemed me. &l7&rBehold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. &l8&rSo Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring

Book9Page39=Chapter 37\nAnd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. &l2&rAnd he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of
Book9Page38=and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Book9Page37=my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? &l21&rBut they held their peace, and answered him not a word\: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. &l22&rThen came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household,
Ch49=B13P37
Book9Page36=of the hand of the king of Assyria? &l19&rWhere are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? &l20&rWho are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of

Book9Page35=&l17&rUntil I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. &l18&rBeware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out
Ch47=B13P4
Book9Page34=&l16&rHearken not to Hezekiah\: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me\: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
Ch46=B12P43
Book9Page33=saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you\: for he shall not be able to deliver you. &l15&rNeither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us\: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Ch45=B12P35
Book9Page32=men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you? &l13&rThen Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. &l14&rThus
Ch44=B12P18
Book9Page31=Syrian language; for we understand it\: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall. &l12&rBut Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the

Book9Page30=horsemen? &l10&rAnd am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. &l11&rThen said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the
Book5Page49=of the daughter of my people. &l5&rFor it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains. &l6&rAnd Elam bare the quiver with chariots of

Ch40=B10P49
Book5Page46=Israel hath spoken it.

Book5Page40=said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth. &l7&rAnd he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed\: &l8&rAnd he cried, A lion\: My lord, I stand
Book9Page29=of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. &l9&rHow then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for

Book13Page24=is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee. &l8&rThus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee\: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to
Book13Page23=the end of the earth. &l7&rThus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that
Book13Page22=shall be my strength. &l6&rAnd he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel\: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto
Book13Page21=my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God. &l5&rAnd now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God
Book13Page20=hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; &l3&rAnd said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. &l4&rThen I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain\: yet surely

Book13Page14=near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I\: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. &l17&rThus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God
Book13Page13=hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him\: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans. &l15&rI, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him\: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. &l16&rCome ye

Book11Page9=&l16&rThou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them\: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. &l17&rWhen the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their

Book4Page10=of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. &l14&rAnd it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up\: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. &l15&rEvery one that is found shall be thrust

Book17Page16=LORD\: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. &l3&rHe that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as

Book12Page3=come, let them shew unto them. &l8&rFear ye not, neither be afraid\: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. &l9&rThey that make a graven image are

Book8Page49=his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; &l16&rHe shall dwell on high\: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks\: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. &l17&rThine eyes shall see the king in his
Book8Page48=us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? &l15&rHe that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth
Book8Page47=burnings of lime\: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. &l13&rHear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. &l14&rThe sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among

Book8Page45=highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth\: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. &l9&rThe earth mourneth and languisheth\: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down\: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
Book8Page44=righteousness. &l6&rAnd wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation\: the fear of the LORD is his treasure. &l7&rBehold, their valiant ones shall cry without\: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. &l8&rThe
Book8Page43=nations were scattered. &l4&rAnd your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller\: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. &l5&rThe LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high\: he hath filled Zion with judgment and
Book8Page42=shall deal treacherously with thee. &l2&rO LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee\: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. &l3&rAt the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the

Book8Page37=people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city\: &l14&rBecause the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a

Book8Page33=shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful. &l6&rFor the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
Book8Page32=land. &l3&rAnd the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. &l4&rThe heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. &l5&rThe vile person
Book8Page31=Chapter 32\nBehold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. &l2&rAnd a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary

Book8Page29=his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. &l8&rThen shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him\: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
Book8Page28=LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it. &l6&rTurn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. &l7&rFor in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and
Book8Page27=multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them\: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. &l5&rAs birds flying, so will the
Book8Page26=the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. &l4&rFor thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a
Book8Page25=is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words\: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. &l3&rNow the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When
Book8Page24=Chapter 31\nWoe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD\! &l2&rYet he also
Book8Page23=breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
Book8Page22=LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps\: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it. &l33&rFor Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large\: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the
Book8Page21=with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones. &l31&rFor through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod. &l32&rAnd in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the

Book12Page50=wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.
Book1Page9=moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth\: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them. &l15&rAnd when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you\: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear\: your hands are full of blood.
Book1Page8=hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? &l13&rBring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. &l14&rYour new
Book1Page7=purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD\: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. &l12&rWhen ye come to appear before me, who
Book1Page6=LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah. &l10&rHear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. &l11&rTo what
Book13Page9=are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. &l8&rYea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened\: for I knew
Book1Page5=burned with fire\: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. &l8&rAnd the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. &l9&rExcept the
Book13Page8=idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. &l6&rThou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. &l7&rThey
Book1Page4=&l6&rFrom the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores\: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. &l7&rYour country is desolate, your cities are
Book13Page7=suddenly, and they came to pass. &l4&rBecause I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; &l5&rI have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee\: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
Book1Page3=that are corrupters\: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. &l5&rWhy should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more\: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
Book13Page6=&l2&rFor they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name. &l3&rI have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them
Book1Page2=brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. &l3&rThe ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib\: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. &l4&rAh sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children
Book13Page5=Chapter 48\nHear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

Book13Page4=there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. &l15&rThus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth\: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
Book13Page3=astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. &l14&rBehold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame\:
Book13Page2=now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. &l13&rThou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
Book8Page19=stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity\: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err. &l29&rYe shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness
Book13Page1=Chapter 47 Cont.\nTherefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth\: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off\: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know. &l12&rStand
Book8Page18=healeth the stroke of their wound. &l27&rBehold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy\: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire\: &l28&rAnd his breath, as an overflowing
Book8Page17=the great slaughter, when the towers fall. &l26&rMoreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and
Book8Page16=likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. &l25&rAnd there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of
Book8Page15=it, Get thee hence. &l23&rThen shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous\: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. &l24&rThe oxen
Book8Page14=it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. &l22&rYe shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold\: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto
Book8Page13=Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers\: &l21&rAnd thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in
Book12Page49=day, the loss of children, and widowhood\: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments. &l10&rFor thou hast trusted in thy wickedness\: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy
Book8Page12=judgment\: blessed are all they that wait for him. &l19&rFor the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem\: thou shalt weep no more\: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. &l20&rAnd though the
Book12Page48=thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children\: &l9&rBut these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
Book8Page11=flee\: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill. &l18&rAnd therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you\: for the LORD is a God of
Book12Page47=shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. &l7&rAnd thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever\: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it. &l8&rTherefore hear now this,
Book8Page10=would not. &l16&rBut ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee\: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. &l17&rOne thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye

Book12Page19=Chapter 45\nThus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; &l2&rI will go before
Book12Page18=to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
Book12Page17=built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof\: &l27&rThat saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers\: &l28&rThat saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure\: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and
Book12Page16=that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; &l26&rThat confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be

Book12Page14=thee. &l23&rSing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it\: shout, ye lower parts of the earth\: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein\: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. &l24&rThus saith the
Book12Page13=Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant\: I have formed thee; thou art my servant\: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. &l22&rI have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins\: return unto me; for I have redeemed

Book2Page8=exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. &l17&rThen shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat. &l18&rWoe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and
Book2Page7=glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. &l15&rAnd the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled\: &l16&rBut the LORD of hosts shall be

Book2Page4=a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. &l10&rYea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. &l11&rWoe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
Book2Page3=but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry. &l8&rWoe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth\! &l9&rIn mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of
Book7Page49=&l22&rTherefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. &l23&rBut when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall
Book2Page2=nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns\: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. &l7&rFor the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant\: and he looked for judgment,
Book7Page48=is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off\: &l21&rThat make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
Book2Page1=Chapter 5 Cont.\nAnd now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard\: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down\: &l6&rAnd I will lay it waste\: it shall not be pruned,

Book7Page46=shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? &l17&rIs it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? &l18&rAnd in that day shall the

Book7Page44=behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder\: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. &l15&rWoe unto them that seek deep to hide their

Ch1=B1P17
Book7Page30=wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. &l22&rNow therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong\: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even
Book3Page49=Chapter 12\nAnd in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee\: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. &l2&rBehold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid\: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my

Book3Page47=they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. &l15&rAnd the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the

Book3Page45=Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. &l12&rAnd he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. &l13&rThe envy also of
Book3Page44=glorious. &l11&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from
Book3Page43=mountain\: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. &l10&rAnd in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek\: and his rest shall be
Book3Page42=ones shall lie down together\: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. &l8&rAnd the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. &l9&rThey shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
Book3Page41=of his reins. &l6&rThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. &l7&rAnd the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
Book3Page40=poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth\: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. &l5&rAnd righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle
Book7Page29=shall be a vexation only to understand the report. &l20&rFor the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it\: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. &l21&rFor the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
Book7Page28=agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. &l19&rFrom the time that it goeth forth it shall take you\: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night\: and it
Book7Page27=make haste. &l17&rJudgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet\: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. &l18&rAnd your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
Book16Page49=a way that was not good, after their own thoughts; &l3&rA people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; &l4&rWhich remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which
Book16Page48=Chapter 65\nI am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not\: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. &l2&rI have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in
Book7Page26=us\: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves\: &l16&rTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation\: he that believeth shall not
Book16Page47=where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire\: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. &l12&rWilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
Book7Page25=the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. &l15&rBecause ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto
Book7Page24=&l13&rBut the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. &l14&rWherefore hear
Book16Page46=&l9&rBe not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever\: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. &l10&rThy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. &l11&rOur holy and our beautiful house,
Book16Page45=name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee\: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. &l8&rBut now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
Book7Page23=line; here a little, and there a little\: &l11&rFor with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. &l12&rTo whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing\: yet they would not hear.
Book7Page22=is no place clean. &l9&rWhom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. &l10&rFor precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon
Book16Page44=continuance, and we shall be saved. &l6&rBut we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. &l7&rAnd there is none that calleth upon thy
Book16Page43=neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. &l5&rThou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways\: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned\: in those is
Book7Page21=way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. &l8&rFor all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there

Book16Page42=that the nations may tremble at thy presence\! &l3&rWhen thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. &l4&rFor since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,
Book16Page41=Chapter 64\nOh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, &l2&rAs when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries,

Book3Page38=Chapter 11\nAnd there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots\: &l2&rAnd the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of

Book3Page36=&l32&rAs yet shall he remain at Nob that day\: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. &l33&rBehold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror\: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn

Book3Page33=hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb\: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. &l27&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken
Book11Page50=pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground\: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring\: &l4&rAnd they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.

Book7Page18=tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. &l3&rThe crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet\: &l4&rAnd the glorious beauty, which is on the head

Book7Page16=and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
Book7Page15=of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. &l13&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
Book16Page37=an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble? &l14&rAs a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest\: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. &l15&rLook down from heaven, and behold from
Book16Page36=the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? &l12&rThat led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? &l13&rThat led them through the deep, as
Book7Page14=set them on fire\: for it is a people of no understanding\: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour. &l12&rAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel

Book16Page32=salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. &l6&rAnd I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth. &l7&rI will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of
Book7Page10=&l5&rOr let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me. &l6&rHe shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root\: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit. &l7&rHath he

Book16Page31=garments, and I will stain all my raiment. &l4&rFor the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. &l5&rAnd I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold\: therefore mine own arm brought
Book16Page30=and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? &l3&rI have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me\: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my
Book11Page45=&l23&rThou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. &l24&rThou hast bought me no sweet cane with money,

Book11Page43=&l19&rBehold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. &l20&rThe beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls\: because I give waters in the
Book3Page26=the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. &l15&rShall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff
Book11Page42=waters; &l17&rWhich bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise\: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow. &l18&rRemember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
Book3Page25=and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man\: &l14&rAnd my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people\: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved
Book11Page41=sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. &l15&rI am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. &l16&rThus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty
Book3Page24=Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. &l13&rFor he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent\: and I have removed the bounds of the people,
Book11Page40=witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God. &l13&rYea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand\: I will work, and who shall let it? &l14&rThus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have
Book3Page23=excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; &l11&rShall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? &l12&rWherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on

Book3Page20=they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. &l5&rO Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. &l6&rI will send him against an hypocritical nation,
Book16Page29=Chapter 63\nWho is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. &l2&rWherefore art thou red in thine apparel,
Book3Page9=henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. &l8&rThe Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. &l9&rAnd all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and

Book3Page8=The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. &l7&rOf the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from

Book16Page26=thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured\: &l9&rBut they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness. &l10&rGo through, go through the gates; prepare ye the
Book16Page25=till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. &l8&rThe LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink
Book3Page6=thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. &l4&rFor thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. &l5&rFor every battle of the warrior is
Book3Page5=Galilee of the nations. &l2&rThe people that walked in darkness have seen a great light\: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. &l3&rThou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy\: they joy before
Book11Page39=before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. &l11&rI, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour. &l12&rI have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you\: therefore ye are my

Book16Page23=neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate\: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah\: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. &l5&rFor as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee\: and as the
Book3Page4=Chapter 9\n &l1&rNevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in
Book11Page38=things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified\: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. &l10&rYe are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen\: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he\:
Book3Page3=their God, and look upward. &l22&rAnd they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.
Book11Page37=I have formed him; yea, I have made him. &l8&rBring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. &l9&rLet all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled\: who among them can declare this, and shew us former
Book16Page22=all kings thy glory\: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name. &l3&rThou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. &l4&rThou shalt no more be termed Forsaken;
Book16Page21=Chapter 62\nFor Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. &l2&rAnd the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and
Book3Page2=speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. &l21&rAnd they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry\: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and
Book11Page36=and gather thee from the west; &l6&rI will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back\: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; &l7&rEven every one that is called by my name\: for I have created him for my glory,
Book3Page19=they may rob the fatherless\! &l3&rAnd what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? &l4&rWithout me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and
Book16Page20=that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
Book3Page18=Chapter 10\nWoe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; &l2&rTo turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that

Book3Page1=Chapter 8 Cont.\nAnd when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter\: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? &l20&rTo the law and to the testimony\: if they

Book11Page34=through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee\: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. &l3&rFor I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour\: I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
Book3Page16=shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied\: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm\: &l21&rManasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh\: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
Book11Page33=Chapter 43\nBut now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not\: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. &l2&rWhen thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
Book3Page15=mount up like the lifting up of smoke. &l19&rThrough the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire\: no man shall spare his brother. &l20&rAnd he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
Book11Page32=burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
Book3Page14=and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. &l18&rFor wickedness burneth as the fire\: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall
Book11Page31=whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law. &l25&rTherefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle\: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it
Book3Page13=leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. &l17&rTherefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows\: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer,

Book3Page12=neither do they seek the LORD of hosts. &l14&rTherefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. &l15&rThe ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. &l16&rFor the
Book3Page11=together; &l12&rThe Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. &l13&rFor the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them,
