Book2Page50=wholly unto the LORD\: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
Book3Page29=Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines\: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. &l17&rAnd when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto
Book3Page28=they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. &l15&rNow the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, &l16&rTo morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of
Book3Page27=the high place to eat\: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. &l14&rAnd they went up into the city\: and when
Book3Page26=them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you\: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place\: &l13&rAs soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to
Book3Page25=to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was. &l11&rAnd as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? &l12&rAnd they answered
Book6Page49=gods. &l44&rAnd the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. &l45&rThen said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield\: but
Book3Page24=that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. &l9&r(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer\: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) &l10&rThen said Saul
Book6Page48=the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him\: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. &l43&rAnd the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his
Book3Page23=what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God\: what have we? &l8&rAnd the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver\:
Book6Page47=and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand\: and he drew near to the Philistine. &l41&rAnd the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. &l42&rAnd when
Book3Page22=Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass\: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. &l7&rThen said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go,
Book6Page46=armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him. &l40&rAnd he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook,
Book3Page21=Benjamites, but they found them not. &l5&rAnd when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us. &l6&rAnd he said unto him,
Book6Page45=the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee. &l38&rAnd Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. &l39&rAnd David girded his sword upon his
Book3Page20=with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. &l4&rAnd he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not\: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not\: and he passed through the land of the
Book6Page44=bear\: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. &l37&rDavid said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of
Book6Page43=bear, and took a lamb out of the flock\: &l35&rAnd I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth\: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. &l36&rThy servant slew both the lion and the
Book6Page42=&l33&rAnd Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him\: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. &l34&rAnd David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a
Book6Page41=former manner. &l31&rAnd when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul\: and he sent for him. &l32&rAnd David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
Book6Page40=heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. &l29&rAnd David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? &l30&rAnd he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner\: and the people answered him again after the
Book2Page49=afraid of the Philistines. &l8&rAnd the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. &l9&rAnd Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering
Book2Page48=And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. &l7&rAnd when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were
Book2Page47=&l5&rAnd Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD. &l6&rAnd they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD.
Book2Page46=gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only\: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. &l4&rThen the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
Book2Page45=Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years\: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. &l3&rAnd Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange
Book2Page44=Chapter 7\nAnd the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. &l2&rAnd it came to pass, while the ark abode in
Book2Page43=he go up from us? &l21&rAnd they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
Book2Page42=the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men\: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. &l20&rAnd the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall
Book2Page41=the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD\: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite. &l19&rAnd he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of
Book2Page40=LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; &l18&rAnd the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto
Book3Page19=and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he\: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. &l3&rAnd the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants
Book3Page18=Chapter 9\nNow there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. &l2&rAnd he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly\:
Book3Page17=Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
Book3Page16=&l20&rThat we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. &l21&rAnd Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. &l22&rAnd the LORD said to
Book3Page9=thee\: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. &l8&rAccording to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me,
Book3Page15=&l18&rAnd ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. &l19&rNevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
Book6Page39=Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine
Book3Page8=a king to judge us like all the nations. &l6&rBut the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. &l7&rAnd the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto
Book3Page14=give to his officers, and to his servants. &l16&rAnd he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. &l17&rHe will take the tenth of your sheep\: and ye shall be his servants.
Book6Page38=and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? &l27&rAnd the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him. &l28&rAnd
Book3Page7=turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. &l4&rThen all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, &l5&rAnd said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways\: now make us
Book3Page13=confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. &l14&rAnd he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. &l15&rAnd he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and
Book6Page37=who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel. &l26&rAnd David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine,
Book3Page6=Chapter 8\nAnd it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. &l2&rNow the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah\: they were judges in Beersheba. &l3&rAnd his sons walked not in his ways, but
Book3Page12=&l12&rAnd he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. &l13&rAnd he will take your daughters to be
Book6Page36=and David heard them. &l24&rAnd all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. &l25&rAnd the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up\: and it shall be, that the man
Book3Page5=from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. &l17&rAnd his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.
Book3Page11=people that asked of him a king. &l11&rAnd he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you\: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.
Book6Page35=carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. &l23&rAnd as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words\:
Book3Page4=restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. &l15&rAnd Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. &l16&rAnd he went
Book3Page10=and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. &l9&rNow therefore hearken unto their voice\: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. &l10&rAnd Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the
Book6Page34=him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle. &l21&rFor Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army. &l22&rAnd David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
Book3Page3=LORD helped us. &l13&rSo the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel\: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. &l14&rAnd the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
Book6Page33=take their pledge. &l19&rNow Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. &l20&rAnd David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded
Book3Page2=&l11&rAnd the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar. &l12&rThen Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
Book6Page32=Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren; &l18&rAnd carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and
Book3Page1=Chapter 7 Cont.\nAnd as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel\: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
Book6Page31=&l14&rAnd David was the youngest\: and the three eldest followed Saul. &l15&rBut David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. &l16&rAnd the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. &l17&rAnd
Book6Page30=for an old man in the days of Saul. &l13&rAnd the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle\: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
Book9Page50=risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul\: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
Book2Page39=sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. &l16&rAnd when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day. &l17&rAnd these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the
Book2Page38=the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD. &l15&rAnd the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone\: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and
Book2Page37=harvest in the valley\: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. &l14&rAnd the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone\: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered
Book2Page36=Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh. &l13&rAnd they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat
Book2Page35=milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home\: &l11&rAnd they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. &l12&rAnd the kine took the straight way to the way of
Book2Page34=&l9&rAnd see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil\: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us. &l10&rAnd the men did so; and took two
Book2Page33=to the cart, and bring their calves home from them\: &l8&rAnd take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
Book2Page32=the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? &l7&rNow therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine
Book2Page31=of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel\: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. &l6&rWherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as
Book2Page30=be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines\: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. &l5&rWherefore ye shall make images
Book6Page29=together. &l11&rWhen Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. &l12&rNow David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons\: and the man went among men
Book6Page28=fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants\: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. &l10&rAnd the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight
Book6Page27=him. &l8&rAnd he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. &l9&rIf he be able to
Book6Page26=of brass. &l6&rAnd he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders. &l7&rAnd the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron\: and one bearing a shield went before
Book6Page25=out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. &l5&rAnd he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels
Book9Page49=that follow my lord. &l28&rI pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid\: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days. &l29&rYet a man is
Book6Page24=and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. &l3&rAnd the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side\: and there was a valley between them. &l4&rAnd there went
Book9Page48=coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. &l27&rAnd now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men
Book6Page23=Chapter 17\nNow the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim. &l2&rAnd Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,
Book9Page47=name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him\: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. &l26&rNow therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from
Book6Page22=his hand\: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
Book9Page46=at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be\: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid. &l25&rLet not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal\: for as his
Book6Page21=became his armourbearer. &l22&rAnd Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. &l23&rAnd it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with
Book9Page45=David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. &l23&rAnd when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, &l24&rAnd fell
Book6Page20=Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep. &l20&rAnd Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. &l21&rAnd David came to Saul, and stood before him\: and he loved him greatly; and he
Book9Page44=met them. &l21&rNow David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him\: and he hath requited me evil for good. &l22&rSo and more also do God unto the enemies of
Book9Page43=said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. &l20&rAnd it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she
Book9Page42=&l18&rThen Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. &l19&rAnd she
Book9Page41=day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. &l17&rNow therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household\: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
Book2Page29=&l3&rAnd they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering\: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. &l4&rThen said they, What shall
Book9Page40=salute our master; and he railed on them. &l15&rBut the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields\: &l16&rThey were a wall unto us both by night and
Book2Page28=Chapter 6\nAnd the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. &l2&rAnd the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.
Book2Page27=it slay us not, and our people\: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. &l12&rAnd the men that died not were smitten with the emerods\: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
Book2Page26=They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. &l11&rSo they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that
Book2Page25=destruction\: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. &l10&rTherefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
Book2Page24=answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither. &l9&rAnd it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great
Book2Page23=the God of Israel shall not abide with us\: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. &l8&rThey sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they
Book2Page22=of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. &l6&rBut the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof. &l7&rAnd when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of
Book2Page21=the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. &l5&rTherefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold
Book2Page20=morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. &l4&rAnd when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before
Book6Page19=Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him. &l19&rWherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said,
Book6Page18=when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. &l17&rAnd Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me. &l18&rThen answered one of the servants, and said,
Book6Page17=troubled him. &l15&rAnd Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. &l16&rLet our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp\: and it shall come to pass,
Book6Page16=horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren\: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. &l14&rBut the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD
Book6Page15=fetch him\: for we will not sit down till he come hither. &l12&rAnd he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him\: for this is he. &l13&rThen Samuel took the
Book9Page39=sword; and David also girded on his sword\: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. &l14&rBut one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to
Book6Page14=before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. &l11&rAnd Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and
Book9Page38=and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? &l12&rSo David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. &l13&rAnd David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his
Book6Page13=&l8&rThen Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. &l9&rThen Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. &l10&rAgain, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass
Book9Page37=answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. &l11&rShall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers,
Book6Page12=before him. &l7&rBut the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him\: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
Book9Page36=come in a good day\: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David. &l9&rAnd when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. &l10&rAnd Nabal
Book6Page11=unto the LORD\: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is
Book9Page35=shearers\: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. &l8&rAsk thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes\: for we
Book6Page10=shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. &l4&rAnd Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? &l5&rAnd he said, Peaceably\: I am come to sacrifice
Book9Page34=you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name\: &l6&rAnd thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. &l7&rAnd now I have heard that thou hast
Book9Page33=a beautiful countenance\: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. &l4&rAnd David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. &l5&rAnd David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get
Book9Page32=Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats\: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. &l3&rNow the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail\: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of
Book9Page31=Chapter 25\nAnd Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. &l2&rAnd there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in
Book2Page19=Chapter 5\nAnd the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod. &l2&rWhen the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. &l3&rAnd when they of Ashdod arose early on the

Book2Page18=said, The glory is departed from Israel\: for the ark of God is taken.
Book2Page17=for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. &l21&rAnd she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel\: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. &l22&rAnd she
Book2Page16=heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. &l20&rAnd about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not;
Book2Page15=from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died\: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. &l19&rAnd his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered\: and when she
Book2Page14=is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. &l18&rAnd it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell
Book2Page13=eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. &l16&rAnd the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? &l17&rAnd the messenger answered and said, Israel
Book2Page12=ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. &l14&rAnd when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. &l15&rNow Eli was ninety and
Book2Page11=were slain. &l12&rAnd there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. &l13&rAnd when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching\: for his heart trembled for the
Book2Page10=Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent\: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. &l11&rAnd the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,
Book9Page29=thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. &l20&rAnd now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. &l21&rSwear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
Book9Page28=evil. &l18&rAnd thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me\: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not. &l19&rFor if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward
Book9Page27=made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. &l17&rAnd he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I\: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee
Book9Page26=king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. &l15&rThe LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. &l16&rAnd it came to pass, when David had
Book9Page25=&l12&rThe LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee\: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. &l13&rAs saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked\: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. &l14&rAfter whom is the
Book9Page24=the skirt of thy robe in my hand\: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
Book9Page23=that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave\: and some bade me kill thee\: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed. &l11&rMoreover, my father, see, yea, see
Book9Page22=king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. &l9&rAnd David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? &l10&rBehold, this day thine eyes have seen how
Book9Page21=&l7&rSo David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. &l8&rDavid also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the
Book9Page20=David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. &l6&rAnd he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
Book2Page9=that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. &l9&rBe strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you\: quit yourselves like men, and fight. &l10&rAnd the
Book2Page8=&l7&rAnd the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us\! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. &l8&rWoe unto us\! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods
Book2Page7=shout, so that the earth rang again. &l6&rAnd when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
Book2Page6=of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims\: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. &l5&rAnd when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great
Book2Page5=Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. &l4&rSo the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant
Book9Page9=knoweth. &l18&rAnd they two made a covenant before the LORD\: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. &l19&rThen came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
Book2Page4=joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines\: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. &l3&rAnd when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the
Book9Page8=and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. &l17&rAnd he said unto him, Fear not\: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father
Book2Page3=Chapter 4\nAnd the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer\: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. &l2&rAnd the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel\: and when they

Book2Page1=Chapter 3 Cont.\nAnd Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. &l20&rAnd all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. &l21&rAnd the LORD appeared again in
Book9Page5=Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down. &l12&rThen said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up. &l13&rThen David and his men, which
Book9Page4=said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. &l11&rWill the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of
Book9Page3=bars. &l8&rAnd Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. &l9&rAnd David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. &l10&rThen
Book9Page2=Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. &l7&rAnd it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and
Book9Page1=Chapter 23 Cont.\nSo David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. &l6&rAnd it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of
Book9Page19=of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. &l5&rAnd it came to pass afterward, that
Book9Page18=his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. &l3&rAnd he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet\: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. &l4&rAnd the men of David said unto him, Behold the day
Book9Page17=Chapter 24\nAnd it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi. &l2&rThen Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and
Book9Page16=called that place Selahammahlekoth. &l29&rAnd David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
Book9Page15=his men round about to take them. &l27&rBut there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. &l28&rWherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines\: therefore they
Ch31=B11P44
Book9Page14=heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. &l26&rAnd Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain\: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and

Book9Page13=Saul\: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. &l25&rSaul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David\: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul

Book11Page40=with him. &l6&rSo Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. &l7&rAnd when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of
Book11Page39=uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. &l5&rAnd when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died
Book11Page38=Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. &l3&rAnd the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. &l4&rThen said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these

Book10Page8=hath kept his servant from evil\: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. &l40&rAnd when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake
Book10Page7=became as a stone. &l38&rAnd it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died. &l39&rAnd when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and
Book10Page6=for he was very drunken\: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. &l37&rBut it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he
Book5Page49=&l22&rAnd Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. &l23&rFor rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,
Book10Page5=said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. &l36&rAnd Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him,
Book5Page48=and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. &l21&rBut the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
Book10Page4=hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. &l35&rSo David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and
Book5Page47=&l19&rWherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD? &l20&rAnd Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me,
Book10Page3=which sent thee this day to meet me\: &l33&rAnd blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. &l34&rFor in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which
Book5Page46=wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? &l18&rAnd the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
Book10Page2=heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself\: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid. &l32&rAnd David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
Book5Page45=the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. &l16&rThen Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. &l17&rAnd Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
Book10Page1=Chapter 25 Cont.\nAnd it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; &l31&rThat this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of
Book5Page44=Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? &l15&rAnd Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites\: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto
Book5Page43=came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. &l13&rAnd Samuel came to Saul\: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD\: I have performed the commandment of the LORD. &l14&rAnd
Book11Page29=those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil. &l21&rAnd David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor\: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the
Book5Page42=Saul to be king\: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. &l12&rAnd when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul
Book11Page28=&l19&rAnd there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them\: David recovered all. &l20&rAnd David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before
Book5Page41=fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them\: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. &l10&rThen came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, &l11&rIt repenteth me that I have set up
Book11Page27=the twilight even unto the evening of the next day\: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. &l18&rAnd David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away\: and David rescued his two wives.
Book5Page40=to Shur, that is over against Egypt. &l8&rAnd he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. &l9&rBut Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the
Book11Page26=had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. &l17&rAnd David smote them from
Book11Page25=with fire. &l15&rAnd David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company. &l16&rAnd when he
Book11Page24=man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. &l14&rWe made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag
Book11Page23=two clusters of raisins\: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him\: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. &l13&rAnd David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young
Book1Page49=the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. &l16&rThen Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. &l17&rAnd he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me\:
Book11Page22=were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. &l11&rAnd they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; &l12&rAnd they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and
Book1Page48=themselves vile, and he restrained them not. &l14&rAnd therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. &l15&rAnd Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of
Book11Page21=and without fail recover all. &l9&rSo David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. &l10&rBut David pursued, he and four hundred men\: for two hundred abode behind, which
Book1Page47=&l12&rIn that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house\: when I begin, I will also make an end. &l13&rFor I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
Book11Page20=pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. &l8&rAnd David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue\: for thou shalt surely overtake them,
Book1Page46=and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. &l11&rAnd the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
Book1Page45=perceived that the LORD had called the child. &l9&rTherefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down\: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. &l10&rAnd the LORD came,
Book1Page44=lie down again. &l7&rNow Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. &l8&rAnd the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
Book1Page43=I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. &l6&rAnd the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son;
Book1Page42=that he could not see; &l3&rAnd ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; &l4&rThat the LORD called Samuel\: and he answered, Here am I. &l5&rAnd he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am
Book1Page41=Chapter 3\nAnd the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. &l2&rAnd it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim,
Book1Page40=&l36&rAnd it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
Book5Page39=among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them\: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. &l7&rAnd Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
Book5Page38=gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. &l5&rAnd Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. &l6&rAnd Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
Book5Page37=Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. &l3&rNow go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. &l4&rAnd Saul
Book5Page36=Chapter 15\nSamuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel\: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. &l2&rThus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
Book5Page35=against the Philistines all the days of Saul\: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
Book5Page34=of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz\: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. &l51&rAnd Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. &l52&rAnd there was sore war
Book5Page33=Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. &l49&rNow the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua\: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal\: &l50&rAnd the name
Book11Page19=distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters\: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God. &l7&rAnd David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I
Book5Page32=against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines\: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. &l48&rAnd he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
Book11Page18=and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. &l5&rAnd David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. &l6&rAnd David was greatly
Book5Page31=this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. &l46&rThen Saul went up from following the Philistines\: and the Philistines went to their own place. &l47&rSo Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side,
Book11Page17=slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way. &l3&rSo David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. &l4&rThen David
Book5Page30=thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. &l45&rAnd the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid\: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God
Book11Page16=Chapter 30\nAnd it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; &l2&rAnd had taken the women captives, that were therein\: they
Book11Page15=as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. &l11&rSo David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
Book11Page14=art good in my sight, as an angel of God\: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle. &l10&rWherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee\: and as soon
Book1Page39=Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. &l35&rAnd I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind\: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
Book8Page50=him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
Book11Page13=said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? &l9&rAnd Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou
Book1Page38=cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart\: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. &l34&rAnd this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and
Book11Page12=good in my sight\: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day\: nevertheless the lords favour thee not. &l7&rWherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. &l8&rAnd David
Book1Page37=that there shall not be an old man in thine house. &l32&rAnd thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel\: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. &l33&rAnd the man of thine, whom I shall not
Book11Page11=sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands? &l6&rThen Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is
Book1Page36=walk before me for ever\: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. &l31&rBehold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house,
Book11Page10=thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us\: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men? &l5&rIs not this David, of whom they
Book1Page35=commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? &l30&rWherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should
Book1Page34=to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? &l29&rWherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
Book1Page33=&l27&rAnd there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? &l28&rAnd did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest,
Book7Page9=&l58&rAnd Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
Book1Page32=if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. &l26&rAnd the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
Book7Page8=soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. &l56&rAnd the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is. &l57&rAnd as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
Book1Page31=unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. &l24&rNay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear\: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress. &l25&rIf one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him\: but
Book7Page7=the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. &l55&rAnd when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy
Book1Page30=and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. &l22&rNow Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. &l23&rAnd he said
Book7Page6=and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. &l53&rAnd the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. &l54&rAnd David took
Book7Page5=of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. &l52&rAnd the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley,
Book7Page4=&l50&rSo David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. &l51&rTherefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out
Book4Page50=with Saul and Jonathan\: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. &l23&rAnd the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
Book7Page3=hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. &l49&rAnd David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
Book7Page2=&l47&rAnd all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear\: for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands. &l48&rAnd it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David
Book7Page1=Chapter 17 Cont.\nThis day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
Book5Page29=taken. &l43&rThen Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die. &l44&rAnd Saul answered, God do so and more also\: for
Book5Page28=unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. &l41&rTherefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken\: but the people escaped. &l42&rAnd Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was
Book5Page27=Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. &l40&rThen said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
Book5Page26=wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. &l38&rAnd Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people\: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. &l39&rFor, as the LORD liveth, which saveth
Book8Page49=the Philistines, and save Keilah. &l3&rAnd David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah\: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? &l4&rThen David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered
Book5Page25=spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. &l37&rAnd Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?
Book8Page48=Chapter 23\nThen they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. &l2&rTherefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite
Book5Page24=all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. &l35&rAnd Saul built an altar unto the LORD\: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD. &l36&rAnd Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and
Book8Page47=would surely tell Saul\: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house. &l23&rAbide thou with me, fear not\: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life\: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
Book5Page23=a great stone unto me this day. &l34&rAnd Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And
Book8Page46=the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. &l21&rAnd Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests. &l22&rAnd David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he
Book5Page22=took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground\: and the people did eat them with the blood. &l33&rThen they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed\: roll
Book8Page45=fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. &l19&rAnd Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. &l20&rAnd one of
Book5Page21=their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? &l31&rAnd they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon\: and the people were very faint. &l32&rAnd the people flew upon the spoil, and
Book8Page44=But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD. &l18&rAnd the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day
Book5Page20=people were faint. &l29&rThen said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land\: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. &l30&rHow much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of
Book8Page43=die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. &l17&rAnd the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.
Book8Page42=&l15&rDid I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me\: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father\: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. &l16&rAnd the king said, Thou shalt surely
Book8Page41=rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? &l14&rThen Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
Book1Page29=sacrifice. &l20&rAnd Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home. &l21&rAnd the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons
Book8Page40=Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. &l13&rAnd Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should
Book1Page28=offering of the LORD. &l18&rBut Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. &l19&rMoreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly
Book1Page27=fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now\: and if not, I will take it by force. &l17&rWherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD\: for men abhorred the
Book1Page26=&l15&rAlso before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. &l16&rAnd if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
Book1Page25=in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; &l14&rAnd he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
Book4Page49=they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. &l22&rSo it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were
Book1Page24=did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. &l12&rNow the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. &l13&rAnd the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was
Book4Page48=throughout all the land of Israel\: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears\: &l20&rBut all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. &l21&rYet
Book1Page23=LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them\: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. &l11&rAnd Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child
Book4Page47=way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual\: &l18&rAnd another company turned the way to Bethhoron\: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. &l19&rNow there was no smith found
Book1Page22=the throne of glory\: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. &l9&rHe will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. &l10&rThe adversaries of the
Book4Page46=Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin\: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. &l17&rAnd the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies\: one company turned unto the
Book1Page21=down to the grave, and bringeth up. &l7&rThe LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich\: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. &l8&rHe raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit
Book4Page45=captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee. &l15&rAnd Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. &l16&rAnd
Book1Page20=girded with strength. &l5&rThey that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased\: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. &l6&rThe LORD killeth, and maketh alive\: he bringeth
Book4Page44=the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee\: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. &l14&rBut now thy kingdom shall not continue\: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be
Book4Page43=The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD\: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. &l13&rAnd Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly\: thou hast not kept the commandment of
Book4Page42=&l11&rAnd Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; &l12&rTherefore said I,
Book4Page41=burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. &l10&rAnd it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
Book4Page40=was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. &l8&rAnd he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed\: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. &l9&rAnd Saul said, Bring hither a

Book5Page18=the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth\: for the people feared the oath. &l27&rBut Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath\: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and
Book5Page17=Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food. &l25&rAnd all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. &l26&rAnd when the people were come into
Book5Page16=the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. &l23&rSo the LORD saved Israel that day\: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven. &l24&rAnd the men of Israel were distressed that day\: for Saul had adjured the people, saying,
Book5Page15=time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. &l22&rLikewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that
Book8Page39=him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. &l11&rThen the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob\: and they came all of them to the king. &l12&rAnd Saul said,
Book5Page14=and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle\: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture. &l21&rMoreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
Book8Page38=against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? &l9&rThen answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. &l10&rAnd he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave
Book5Page13=God was at that time with the children of Israel. &l19&rAnd it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased\: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. &l20&rAnd Saul
Book8Page37=of hundreds; &l8&rThat all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant
Book5Page12=&l17&rThen said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. &l18&rAnd Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of
Book8Page36=hand, and all his servants were standing about him;) &l7&rThen Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains
Book5Page11=garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked\: so it was a very great trembling. &l16&rAnd the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
Book8Page35=depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. &l6&rWhen Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his
Book5Page10=&l14&rAnd that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow. &l15&rAnd there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people\: the
Book8Page34=thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me. &l4&rAnd he brought them before the king of Moab\: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold. &l5&rAnd the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
Book8Page33=that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them\: and there were with him about four hundred men. &l3&rAnd David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab\: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray
Book8Page32=Chapter 22\nDavid therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam\: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him. &l2&rAnd every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one
Book8Page31=mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
Book8Page30=feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. &l14&rThen said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad\: wherefore then have ye brought him to me? &l15&rHave I need of
Book1Page19=is there any rock like our God. &l3&rTalk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth\: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. &l4&rThe bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are
Book1Page18=Chapter 2\nAnd Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD\: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. &l2&rThere is none holy as the LORD\: for there is none beside thee\: neither

Book1Page16=soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. &l27&rFor this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him\: &l28&rTherefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall

Book4Page39=were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. &l7&rAnd some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he
Book1Page14=&l23&rAnd Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. &l24&rAnd when she had weaned him, she took him up
Book4Page38=together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude\: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. &l6&rWhen the men of Israel saw that they
Book1Page13=to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. &l22&rBut Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
Book4Page37=&l4&rAnd all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. &l5&rAnd the Philistines gathered themselves
Book1Page12=remembered her. &l20&rWherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. &l21&rAnd the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up
Book4Page36=and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. &l3&rAnd Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
Book1Page11=So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. &l19&rAnd they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah\: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD
Book4Page35=Chapter 13\nSaul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, &l2&rSaul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin\:
Book1Page10=out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. &l17&rThen Eli answered and said, Go in peace\: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. &l18&rAnd she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.
Book4Page34=your king.
Book4Page33=for you\: but I will teach you the good and the right way\: &l24&rOnly fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart\: for consider how great things he hath done for you. &l25&rBut if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and
Book4Page32=nor deliver; for they are vain. &l22&rFor the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake\: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. &l23&rMoreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray
Book4Page31=&l20&rAnd Samuel said unto the people, Fear not\: ye have done all this wickedness\: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; &l21&rAnd turn ye not aside\: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit
Book4Page30=sent thunder and rain that day\: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. &l19&rAnd all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not\: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
Book7Page50=said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
Book8Page29=one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? &l12&rAnd David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. &l13&rAnd he changed his behaviour before them, and
Book8Page28=And David said, There is none like that; give it me. &l10&rAnd David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. &l11&rAnd the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing
Book8Page27=business required haste. &l9&rAnd the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod\: if thou wilt take that, take it\: for there is no other save that here.
Book8Page26=his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul. &l8&rAnd David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's
Book8Page25=him hallowed bread\: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. &l7&rNow a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and
Book8Page24=said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel. &l6&rSo the priest gave
Book8Page23=mine hand, or what there is present. &l4&rAnd the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women. &l5&rAnd David answered the priest, and
Book8Page22=and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee\: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place. &l3&rNow therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in
Book8Page21=Chapter 21\nThen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest\: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee? &l2&rAnd David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business,
Book8Page20=and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed\: and Jonathan went into the city.
Book4Page29=harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. &l18&rSo Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD
Book4Page28=of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers. &l16&rNow therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes. &l17&rIs it not wheat
Book4Page27=&l14&rIf ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God\: &l15&rBut if ye will not obey the voice
Book4Page26=Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us\: when the LORD your God was your king. &l13&rNow therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired\! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
Book7Page49=said, Far be it from thee\: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? &l10&rThen said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly? &l11&rAnd Jonathan
Book4Page25=our enemies, and we will serve thee. &l11&rAnd the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. &l12&rAnd when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of
Book7Page48=&l8&rTherefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee\: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father? &l9&rAnd Jonathan
Book4Page24=Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. &l10&rAnd they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth\: but now deliver us out of the hand of
Book7Page47=asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city\: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. &l7&rIf he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace\: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
Book4Page23=LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. &l9&rAnd when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
Book7Page46=David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat\: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. &l6&rIf thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly
Book4Page22=land of Egypt. &l7&rNow therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers. &l8&rWhen Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the
Book7Page45=saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved\: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death. &l4&rThen said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee. &l5&rAnd
Book4Page21=against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness. &l6&rAnd Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
Book7Page44=father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me\: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. &l3&rAnd David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he
Book4Page20=whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. &l4&rAnd they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. &l5&rAnd he said unto them, The LORD is witness
Book7Page43=Chapter 20\nAnd David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? &l2&rAnd he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die\: behold, my
Book7Page42=prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. &l24&rAnd he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
Book7Page41=came to a great well that is in Sechu\: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah. &l23&rAnd he went thither to Naioth in Ramah\: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and
Book7Page40=upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. &l21&rAnd when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. &l22&rThen went he also to Ramah, and
Book8Page19=times\: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. &l42&rAnd Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed
Book6Page9=sons. &l2&rAnd Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. &l3&rAnd call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do\: and thou
Book8Page18=matter. &l40&rAnd Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city. &l41&rAnd as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three
Book6Page8=Chapter 16\n &l1&rAnd the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite\: for I have provided me a king among his
Book8Page17=lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee? &l38&rAnd Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. &l39&rBut the lad knew not any thing\: only Jonathan and David knew the
Book6Page7=Saul until the day of his death\: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul\: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
Book8Page16=little lad with him. &l36&rAnd he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. &l37&rAnd when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the
Book6Page6=sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. &l34&rThen Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. &l35&rAnd Samuel came no more to see
Book8Page15=fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month\: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. &l35&rAnd it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a
Book6Page5=turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD. &l32&rThen said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. &l33&rAnd Samuel said, As thy
Book8Page14=Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done? &l33&rAnd Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him\: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. &l34&rSo Jonathan arose from the table in
Book6Page4=nor repent\: for he is not a man, that he should repent. &l30&rThen he said, I have sinned\: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. &l31&rSo Samuel
Book8Page13=and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness? &l31&rFor as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. &l32&rAnd Jonathan answered
Book8Page12=my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table. &l30&rThen Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion,
Book6Page3=upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. &l28&rAnd Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. &l29&rAnd also the Strength of Israel will not lie
Book6Page2=that I may worship the LORD. &l26&rAnd Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee\: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. &l27&rAnd as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold
Book8Page11=leave of me to go to Bethlehem\: &l29&rAnd he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there\: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see
Book8Page10=the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty\: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day? &l28&rAnd Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked
Book6Page1=Chapter 15 Cont.\nAnd Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned\: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words\: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. &l25&rNow therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me,
Book4Page19=you\: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day. &l3&rBehold, here I am\: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed\: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of
Book4Page18=Chapter 12\nAnd Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. &l2&rAnd now, behold, the king walketh before you\: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with
Book4Page17=in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
Book4Page16=death this day\: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel. &l14&rThen said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. &l15&rAnd all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD
Book4Page15=remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. &l12&rAnd the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death. &l13&rAnd Saul said, There shall not a man be put to
Book7Page39=in Naioth. &l19&rAnd it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah. &l20&rAnd Saul sent messengers to take David\: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was
Book4Page14=seemeth good unto you. &l11&rAnd it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day\: and it came to pass, that they which
Book7Page38=away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee? &l18&rSo David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt
Book4Page13=To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. &l10&rTherefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that
Book7Page37=Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. &l16&rAnd when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster. &l17&rAnd Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent
Book4Page12=came out with one consent. &l8&rAnd when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. &l9&rAnd they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead,
Book7Page36=took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth. &l14&rAnd when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick. &l15&rAnd Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying,
Book4Page11=hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they
Book7Page35=watch him, and to slay him in the morning\: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. &l12&rSo Michal let David down through a window\: and he went, and fled, and escaped. &l13&rAnd Michal
Book4Page10=field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. &l6&rAnd the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly. &l7&rAnd he took a yoke of oxen, and
Book7Page34=hand. &l10&rAnd Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall\: and David fled, and escaped that night. &l11&rSaul also sent messengers unto David's house, to
Book7Page33=again\: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him. &l9&rAnd the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand\: and David played with his
Book7Page32=of Jonathan\: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain. &l7&rAnd Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past. &l8&rAnd there was war
Book7Page31=life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel\: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice\: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? &l6&rAnd Saul hearkened unto the voice
Book7Page30=&l4&rAnd Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to theeward very good\: &l5&rFor he did put his
Book7Page29=take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself\: &l3&rAnd I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
Book7Page28=Chapter 19\nAnd Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. &l2&rBut Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David\: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee\: now therefore, I pray thee,
Book7Page27=became David's enemy continually. &l30&rThen the princes of the Philistines went forth\: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
Book7Page26=king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. &l28&rAnd Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him. &l29&rAnd Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul
Book7Page25=pleased David well to be the king's son in law\: and the days were not expired. &l27&rWherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the
Book7Page24=say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. &l26&rAnd when his servants told David these words, it
Book7Page23=the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? &l24&rAnd the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. &l25&rAnd Saul said, Thus shall ye
Book7Page22=the twain. &l22&rAnd Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee\: now therefore be the king's son in law. &l23&rAnd Saul's servants spake those words in
Book7Page21=they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. &l21&rAnd Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of
Book7Page20=Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? &l19&rBut it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. &l20&rAnd Michal Saul's daughter loved David\: and
Book10Page50=departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? &l17&rAnd the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me\: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David\:
Book7Page19=thee to wife\: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. &l18&rAnd David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in
Book7Page18=&l15&rWherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. &l16&rBut all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them. &l17&rAnd Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give
Book7Page17=and was departed from Saul. &l13&rTherefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. &l14&rAnd David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
Book7Page16=other times\: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. &l11&rAnd Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. &l12&rAnd Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
Book7Page15=can he have more but the kingdom? &l9&rAnd Saul eyed David from that day and forward. &l10&rAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house\: and David played with his hand, as at
Book7Page14=they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. &l8&rAnd Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands\: and what
Book7Page13=came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. &l7&rAnd the women answered one another as
Book7Page12=girdle. &l5&rAnd David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely\: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. &l6&rAnd it came to pass as they
Book7Page11=father's house. &l3&rThen Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. &l4&rAnd Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his
Book7Page10=Chapter 18\nAnd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. &l2&rAnd Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his
Book10Page49=me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams\: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. &l16&rThen said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is
Book10Page48=And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. &l15&rAnd Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against
Book10Page47=&l13&rAnd the king said unto her, Be not afraid\: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. &l14&rAnd he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle.
Book10Page46=thing. &l11&rThen said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. &l12&rAnd when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice\: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
Book10Page45=those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land\: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? &l10&rAnd Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this
Book10Page44=him, and they came to the woman by night\: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. &l9&rAnd the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off
Book10Page43=that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. &l8&rAnd Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with
Book10Page42=Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. &l6&rAnd when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. &l7&rThen said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman
Book10Page41=Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. &l4&rAnd the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem\: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. &l5&rAnd when
Book10Page40=said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. &l3&rNow Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And
Book5Page9=armourbearer, Come up after me\: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. &l13&rAnd Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him\: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
Book5Page8=Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. &l12&rAnd the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his
Book5Page7=unto them. &l10&rBut if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up\: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand\: and this shall be a sign unto us. &l11&rAnd both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines\: and the
Book5Page6=thee according to thy heart. &l8&rThen said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. &l9&rIf they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up
Book5Page5=over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised\: it may be that the LORD will work for us\: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. &l7&rAnd his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart\: turn thee; behold, I am with
Book5Page4=the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. &l5&rThe forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. &l6&rAnd Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go
Ch9=B3P37
Book5Page3=wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. &l4&rAnd between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side\: and the name of
Ch8=B3P17
Book5Page2=the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron\: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men; &l3&rAnd Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh,
Ch7=B3P5
Book5Page1=Chapter 14\nNow it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father. &l2&rAnd Saul tarried in

Ch4=B2P18
Ch3=B2P2
Ch2=B1P40
Ch1=B1P17
Book10Page39=Chapter 28\nAnd it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. &l2&rAnd David
Book10Page38=therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
Book10Page37=tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. &l12&rAnd Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him;
Book10Page36=to Achish. &l10&rAnd Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites. &l11&rAnd David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring
Book10Page35=inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. &l9&rAnd David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came
Book10Page34=unto this day. &l7&rAnd the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. &l8&rAnd David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites\: for those nations were of old the
Book10Page33=grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there\: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee? &l6&rThen Achish gave him Ziklag that day\: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah
Book10Page32=household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. &l4&rAnd it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath\: and he sought no more again for him. &l5&rAnd David said unto Achish, If I have now found
Book10Page31=of Israel\: so shall I escape out of his hand. &l2&rAnd David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath. &l3&rAnd David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his
Book10Page30=Chapter 27\n &l1&rAnd David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul\: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast
Book10Page29=tribulation. &l25&rThen Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David\: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
Book10Page28=thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed. &l24&rAnd, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all
Book10Page27=played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. &l22&rAnd David answered and said, Behold the king's spear\! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. &l23&rThe LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness\: for the LORD delivered
Book10Page26=king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. &l21&rThen said Saul, I have sinned\: return, my son David\: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day\: behold, I have
Book10Page25=children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods. &l20&rNow therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD\: for the
Book10Page24=pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? &l19&rNow therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering\: but if they be the
Book10Page23=now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster. &l17&rAnd Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. &l18&rAnd he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus
Book10Page22=thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. &l16&rThis thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And
Book10Page21=people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? &l15&rAnd David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast
Book10Page20=neither awaked\: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them. &l13&rThen David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them\: &l14&rAnd David cried to the
Book10Page19=LORD'S anointed\: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. &l12&rSo David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it,
Book10Page18=anointed, and be guiltless? &l10&rDavid said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish. &l11&rThe LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the
Book10Page17=thine hand this day\: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time. &l9&rAnd David said to Abishai, Destroy him not\: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S
Book10Page16=Abishai came to the people by night\: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster\: but Abner and the people lay round about him. &l8&rThen said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into
Book10Page15=pitched round about him. &l6&rThen answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. &l7&rSo David and
Book10Page14=and understood that Saul was come in very deed. &l5&rAnd David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched\: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host\: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people
Book10Page13=to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. &l3&rAnd Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. &l4&rDavid therefore sent out spies,
Book10Page12=Chapter 26\nAnd the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon? &l2&rThen Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him,
Book10Page11=given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.
Book10Page10=hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. &l43&rDavid also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. &l44&rBut Saul had
Book3Page50=of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you\:
Book4Page9=be no man to save us, we will come out to thee. &l4&rThen came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people\: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. &l5&rAnd, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the
Book4Page8=covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel. &l3&rAnd the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel\: and then, if there
Book4Page7=Chapter 11\nThen Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead\: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. &l2&rAnd Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a
Book4Page6=went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched. &l27&rBut the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
Book4Page5=said, God save the king. &l25&rThen Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. &l26&rAnd Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there
Book4Page4=stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. &l24&rAnd Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and
Book4Page3=when they sought him, he could not be found. &l22&rTherefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff. &l23&rAnd they ran and fetched him thence\: and when he
Book4Page2=&l20&rAnd when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. &l21&rWhen he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken\: and
Book4Page1=Chapter 10 Cont.\nAnd ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
Book3Page49=whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. &l17&rAnd Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh; &l18&rAnd said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand
Book3Page48=and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel. &l15&rAnd Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. &l16&rAnd Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom,
Book3Page47=father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? &l13&rAnd when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. &l14&rAnd Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses\:
Book3Page46=him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? &l12&rAnd one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
Book3Page45=another heart\: and all those signs came to pass that day. &l10&rAnd when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. &l11&rAnd it came to pass, when all that knew
Book3Page44=unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings\: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. &l9&rAnd it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him
Book3Page43=prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. &l7&rAnd let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee. &l8&rAnd thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down
Book3Page42=to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy\: &l6&rAnd the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
Book3Page41=&l4&rAnd they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. &l5&rAfter that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines\: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither
Book3Page40=&l3&rThen shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine\:
Book3Page39=Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found\: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
Book3Page38=Chapter 10\nThen Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance? &l2&rWhen thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by
Book3Page37=to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
Book3Page36=arose early\: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. &l27&rAnd as they were going down
Book3Page35=this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. &l25&rAnd when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house. &l26&rAnd they
Book3Page34=Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. &l24&rAnd the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left\! set it before thee, and eat\: for unto
Book3Page33=wherefore then speakest thou so to me? &l22&rAnd Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons. &l23&rAnd Samuel said unto the cook,
