Book2Page50=knowledge\: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction. &l15&rThe rich man's wealth is his strong city\: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. &l16&rThe labour of the righteous tendeth to life\: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
Book3Page29=shall bear rule\: but the slothful shall be under tribute. &l25&rHeaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop\: but a good word maketh it glad. &l26&rThe righteous is more excellent than his neighbour\: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. &l27&rThe
Book3Page28=but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. &l22&rLying lips are abomination to the LORD\: but they that deal truly are his delight. &l23&rA prudent man concealeth knowledge\: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. &l24&rThe hand of the diligent
Book3Page27=the wise is health. &l19&rThe lip of truth shall be established for ever\: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. &l20&rDeceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil\: but to the counsellers of peace is joy. &l21&rThere shall no evil happen to the just\:
Book3Page26=counsel is wise. &l16&rA fool's wrath is presently known\: but a prudent man covereth shame. &l17&rHe that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness\: but a false witness deceit. &l18&rThere is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword\: but the tongue of
Book3Page25=but the just shall come out of trouble. &l14&rA man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth\: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. &l15&rThe way of a fool is right in his own eyes\: but he that hearkeneth unto
Book6Page49=blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. &l15&rA continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. &l16&rWhosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
Book3Page24=his land shall be satisfied with bread\: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding. &l12&rThe wicked desireth the net of evil men\: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. &l13&rThe wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips\:
Book6Page48=I may answer him that reproacheth me. &l12&rA prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. &l13&rTake his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. &l14&rHe that
Book3Page23=heart shall be despised. &l9&rHe that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. &l10&rA righteous man regardeth the life of his beast\: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. &l11&rHe that tilleth
Book6Page47=hearty counsel. &l10&rThine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity\: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. &l11&rMy son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that
Book3Page22=are to lie in wait for blood\: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. &l7&rThe wicked are overthrown, and are not\: but the house of the righteous shall stand. &l8&rA man shall be commended according to his wisdom\: but he that is of a perverse
Book6Page46=loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. &l8&rAs a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. &l9&rOintment and perfume rejoice the heart\: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by
Book3Page21=righteous shall not be moved. &l4&rA virtuous woman is a crown to her husband\: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. &l5&rThe thoughts of the righteous are right\: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. &l6&rThe words of the wicked
Book6Page45=heavier than them both. &l4&rWrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? &l5&rOpen rebuke is better than secret love. &l6&rFaithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. &l7&rThe full soul
Book3Page20=Chapter 12\nWhoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge\: but he that hateth reproof is brutish. &l2&rA good man obtaineth favour of the LORD\: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. &l3&rA man shall not be established by wickedness\: but the root of the
Book6Page44=Chapter 27\nBoast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. &l2&rLet another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. &l3&rA stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
Book6Page43=whole congregation. &l27&rWhoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein\: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. &l28&rA lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
Book6Page42=&l24&rHe that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; &l25&rWhen he speaketh fair, believe him not\: for there are seven abominations in his heart. &l26&rWhose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the
Book6Page41=coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. &l22&rThe words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. &l23&rBurning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
Book6Page40=casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, &l19&rSo is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? &l20&rWhere no wood is, there the fire goeth out\: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. &l21&rAs coals are to burning
Book2Page49=violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. &l12&rHatred stirreth up strifes\: but love covereth all sins. &l13&rIn the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found\: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. &l14&rWise men lay up
Book2Page48=fool shall fall. &l9&rHe that walketh uprightly walketh surely\: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. &l10&rHe that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow\: but a prating fool shall fall. &l11&rThe mouth of a righteous man is a well of life\: but
Book2Page47=that causeth shame. &l6&rBlessings are upon the head of the just\: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. &l7&rThe memory of the just is blessed\: but the name of the wicked shall rot. &l8&rThe wise in heart will receive commandments\: but a prating
Book2Page46=righteous to famish\: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. &l4&rHe becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand\: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. &l5&rHe that gathereth in summer is a wise son\: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son
Book2Page45=Chapter 10\nThe proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father\: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. &l2&rTreasures of wickedness profit nothing\: but righteousness delivereth from death. &l3&rThe LORD will not suffer the soul of the
Book2Page44=&l18&rBut he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
Book2Page43=places of the city, &l15&rTo call passengers who go right on their ways\: &l16&rWhoso is simple, let him turn in hither\: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, &l17&rStolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
Book2Page42=increased. &l12&rIf thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself\: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. &l13&rA foolish woman is clamorous\: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. &l14&rFor she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high
Book2Page41=be yet wiser\: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. &l10&rThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom\: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. &l11&rFor by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be
Book2Page40=&l7&rHe that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame\: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. &l8&rReprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee\: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. &l9&rGive instruction to a wise man, and he will
Book3Page19=wise. &l31&rBehold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth\: much more the wicked and the sinner.
Book3Page18=shall fall\: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. &l29&rHe that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind\: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. &l30&rThe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is
Book3Page17=withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him\: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. &l27&rHe that diligently seeketh good procureth favour\: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. &l28&rHe that trusteth in his riches
Book3Page16=is wrath. &l24&rThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. &l25&rThe liberal soul shall be made fat\: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. &l26&rHe that
Book3Page9=shall deliver them\: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness. &l7&rWhen a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish\: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. &l8&rThe righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his
Book3Page15=wicked shall not be unpunished\: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. &l22&rAs a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion. &l23&rThe desire of the righteous is only good\: but the expectation of the wicked
Book6Page39=it again to his mouth. &l16&rThe sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. &l17&rHe that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. &l18&rAs a mad man who
Book3Page8=shall destroy them. &l4&rRiches profit not in the day of wrath\: but righteousness delivereth from death. &l5&rThe righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way\: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. &l6&rThe righteousness of the upright
Book3Page14=&l19&rAs righteousness tendeth to life\: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. &l20&rThey that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD\: but such as are upright in their way are his delight. &l21&rThough hand join in hand, the
Book6Page38=a fool than of him. &l13&rThe slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. &l14&rAs the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. &l15&rThe slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring
Book3Page7=Chapter 11\nA false balance is abomination to the LORD\: but a just weight is his delight. &l2&rWhen pride cometh, then cometh shame\: but with the lowly is wisdom. &l3&rThe integrity of the upright shall guide them\: but the perverseness of transgressors
Book3Page13=retaineth honour\: and strong men retain riches. &l17&rThe merciful man doeth good to his own soul\: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. &l18&rThe wicked worketh a deceitful work\: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.
Book6Page37=mouth of fools. &l10&rThe great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. &l11&rAs a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. &l12&rSeest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of
Book3Page6=removed\: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. &l31&rThe mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom\: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. &l32&rThe lips of the righteous know what is acceptable\: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.
Book3Page12=spirit concealeth the matter. &l14&rWhere no counsel is, the people fall\: but in the multitude of counsellers there is safety. &l15&rHe that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it\: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. &l16&rA gracious woman
Book6Page36=drinketh damage. &l7&rThe legs of the lame are not equal\: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. &l8&rAs he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. &l9&rAs a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the
Book3Page5=shortened. &l28&rThe hope of the righteous shall be gladness\: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. &l29&rThe way of the LORD is strength to the upright\: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. &l30&rThe righteous shall never be
Book3Page11=the upright the city is exalted\: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. &l12&rHe that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour\: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. &l13&rA talebearer revealeth secrets\: but he that is of a faithful
Book6Page35=fool's back. &l4&rAnswer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. &l5&rAnswer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. &l6&rHe that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and
Book3Page4=the wicked no more\: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. &l26&rAs vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. &l27&rThe fear of the LORD prolongeth days\: but the years of the wicked shall be
Book3Page10=stead. &l9&rAn hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour\: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. &l10&rWhen it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth\: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. &l11&rBy the blessing of
Book6Page34=Chapter 26\nAs snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. &l2&rAs the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. &l3&rA whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
Book3Page3=addeth no sorrow with it. &l23&rIt is as sport to a fool to do mischief\: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. &l24&rThe fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him\: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. &l25&rAs the whirlwind passeth, so is
Book6Page33=that is broken down, and without walls.
Book3Page2=that refraineth his lips is wise. &l20&rThe tongue of the just is as choice silver\: the heart of the wicked is little worth. &l21&rThe lips of the righteous feed many\: but fools die for want of wisdom. &l22&rThe blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he
Book6Page32=&l26&rA righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. &l27&rIt is not good to eat much honey\: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. &l28&rHe that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city
Book3Page1=Chapter 10 Cont.\nHe is in the way of life that keepeth instruction\: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. &l18&rHe that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool. &l19&rIn the multitude of words there wanteth not sin\: but he
Book6Page31=driveth away rain\: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. &l24&rIt is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. &l25&rAs cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
Book6Page30=is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. &l21&rIf thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink\: &l22&rFor thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. &l23&rThe north wind
Book2Page39=city, &l4&rWhoso is simple, let him turn in hither\: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, &l5&rCome, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. &l6&rForsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
Book2Page38=Chapter 9\nWisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars\: &l2&rShe hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. &l3&rShe hath sent forth her maidens\: she crieth upon the highest places of the
Book2Page37=me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. &l36&rBut he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul\: all they that hate me love death.
Book2Page36=hearken unto me, O ye children\: for blessed are they that keep my ways. &l33&rHear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. &l34&rBlessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. &l35&rFor whoso findeth
Book2Page35=foundations of the earth\: &l30&rThen I was by him, as one brought up with him\: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; &l31&rRejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. &l32&rNow therefore
Book2Page34=set a compass upon the face of the depth\: &l28&rWhen he established the clouds above\: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep\: &l29&rWhen he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment\: when he appointed the
Book2Page33=with water. &l25&rBefore the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth\: &l26&rWhile as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. &l27&rWhen he prepared the heavens, I was there\: when he
Book2Page32=&l22&rThe LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. &l23&rI was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. &l24&rWhen there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding
Book2Page31=is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. &l20&rI lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment\: &l21&rThat I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
Book2Page30=decree justice. &l16&rBy me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. &l17&rI love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. &l18&rRiches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. &l19&rMy fruit
Book6Page29=against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. &l19&rConfidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. &l20&rAs he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so
Book6Page28=bone. &l16&rHast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. &l17&rWithdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. &l18&rA man that beareth false witness
Book6Page27=is a faithful messenger to them that send him\: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. &l14&rWhoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. &l15&rBy long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the
Book6Page26=thine infamy turn not away. &l11&rA word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. &l12&rAs an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. &l13&rAs the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so
Book6Page25=hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. &l9&rDebate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another\: &l10&rLest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and
Book6Page24=thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men\: &l7&rFor better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. &l8&rGo not forth
Book6Page23=the heart of kings is unsearchable. &l4&rTake away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. &l5&rTake away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. &l6&rPut not forth
Book6Page22=Chapter 25\nThese are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. &l2&rIt is the glory of God to conceal a thing\: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. &l3&rThe heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and
Book6Page21=considered it well\: I looked upon it, and received instruction. &l33&rYet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep\: &l34&rSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
Book6Page20=went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; &l31&rAnd, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. &l32&rThen I saw, and
Book2Page29=witty inventions. &l13&rThe fear of the LORD is to hate evil\: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. &l14&rCounsel is mine, and sound wisdom\: I am understanding; I have strength. &l15&rBy me kings reign, and princes
Book2Page28=&l10&rReceive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. &l11&rFor wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. &l12&rI wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of
Book2Page27=shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. &l8&rAll the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. &l9&rThey are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
Book2Page26=O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. &l5&rO ye simple, understand wisdom\: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. &l6&rHear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. &l7&rFor my mouth
Book2Page25=Chapter 8\nDoth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? &l2&rShe standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. &l3&rShe crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. &l4&rUnto you,
Book2Page24=my mouth. &l25&rLet not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. &l26&rFor she hath cast down many wounded\: yea, many strong men have been slain by her. &l27&rHer house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
Book2Page23=the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; &l23&rTill a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. &l24&rHearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of
Book2Page22=journey\: &l20&rHe hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. &l21&rWith her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. &l22&rHe goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to
Book2Page21=carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. &l17&rI have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. &l18&rCome, let us take our fill of love until the morning\: let us solace ourselves with loves. &l19&rFor the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long
Book2Page20=impudent face said unto him, &l14&rI have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. &l15&rTherefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. &l16&rI have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with
Book6Page19=in the field; and afterwards build thine house. &l28&rBe not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips. &l29&rSay not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me\: I will render to the man according to his work. &l30&rI
Book6Page18=people curse, nations shall abhor him\: &l25&rBut to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. &l26&rEvery man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. &l27&rPrepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself
Book6Page17=&l22&rFor their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? &l23&rThese things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment. &l24&rHe that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the
Book6Page16=because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked; &l20&rFor there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out. &l21&rMy son, fear thou the LORD and the king\: and meddle not with them that are given to change\:
Book6Page15=again\: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. &l17&rRejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth\: &l18&rLest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. &l19&rFret not thyself
Book6Page14=when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. &l15&rLay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place\: &l16&rFor a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up
Book6Page13=keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works? &l13&rMy son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste\: &l14&rSo shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul\:
Book6Page12=day of adversity, thy strength is small. &l11&rIf thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; &l12&rIf thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that
Book6Page11=&l7&rWisdom is too high for a fool\: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. &l8&rHe that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. &l9&rThe thought of foolishness is sin\: and the scorner is an abomination to men. &l10&rIf thou faint in the
Book6Page10=knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. &l5&rA wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. &l6&rFor by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war\: and in multitude of counsellers there is safety.
Book2Page19=with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. &l11&r(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house\: &l12&rNow is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) &l13&rSo she caught him, and kissed him, and with an
Book2Page18=discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, &l8&rPassing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, &l9&rIn the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night\: &l10&rAnd, behold, there met him a woman
Book2Page17=sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman\: &l5&rThat they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. &l6&rFor at the window of my house I looked through my casement, &l7&rAnd beheld among the simple ones, I
Book2Page16=Chapter 7\nMy son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. &l2&rKeep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. &l3&rBind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. &l4&rSay unto wisdom, Thou art my

Book4Page40=words\: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. &l28&rEven a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise\: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
Book5Page19=with his lips. &l20&rWhoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. &l21&rAn inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. &l22&rSay not thou, I will recompense evil;
Book5Page18=sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. &l18&rEvery purpose is established by counsel\: and with good advice make war. &l19&rHe that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets\: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth
Book5Page17=is gone his way, then he boasteth. &l15&rThere is gold, and a multitude of rubies\: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. &l16&rTake his garment that is surety for a stranger\: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. &l17&rBread of deceit is
Book5Page16=right. &l12&rThe hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. &l13&rLove not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. &l14&rIt is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer\: but when he
Book5Page15=eyes. &l9&rWho can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? &l10&rDivers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. &l11&rEven a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be
Book5Page14=&l6&rMost men will proclaim every one his own goodness\: but a faithful man who can find? &l7&rThe just man walketh in his integrity\: his children are blessed after him. &l8&rA king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his
Book5Page13=strife\: but every fool will be meddling. &l4&rThe sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. &l5&rCounsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
Book5Page12=Chapter 20\nWine is a mocker, strong drink is raging\: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. &l2&rThe fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion\: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. &l3&rIt is an honour for a man to cease from

Book1Page19=that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. &l20&rThat thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. &l21&rFor the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
Book1Page18=thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; &l17&rWhich forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. &l18&rFor her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. &l19&rNone
Book1Page17=speaketh froward things; &l13&rWho leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; &l14&rWho rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; &l15&rWhose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths\: &l16&rTo deliver
Book1Page16=equity; yea, every good path. &l10&rWhen wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; &l11&rDiscretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee\: &l12&rTo deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that
Book1Page15=understanding. &l7&rHe layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous\: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. &l8&rHe keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. &l9&rThen shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
Book4Page39=but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. &l25&rA foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. &l26&rAlso to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. &l27&rHe that hath knowledge spareth his
Book1Page14=understanding; &l4&rIf thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; &l5&rThen shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. &l6&rFor the LORD giveth wisdom\: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
Book4Page38=the father of a fool hath no joy. &l22&rA merry heart doeth good like a medicine\: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. &l23&rA wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. &l24&rWisdom is before him that hath understanding;
Book1Page13=Chapter 2\nMy son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; &l2&rSo that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; &l3&rYea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for
Book4Page37=transgression that loveth strife\: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. &l20&rHe that hath a froward heart findeth no good\: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. &l21&rHe that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow\: and

Book4Page36=hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? &l17&rA friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. &l18&rA man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. &l19&rHe loveth
Book1Page11=that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD\: &l30&rThey would none of my counsel\: they despised all my reproof. &l31&rTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. &l32&rFor the turning
Book4Page35=of strife is as when one letteth out water\: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. &l15&rHe that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. &l16&rWherefore is there a price in the
Book1Page10=&l27&rWhen your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. &l28&rThen shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me\: &l29&rFor
Book4Page34=seeketh only rebellion\: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. &l12&rLet a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. &l13&rWhoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. &l14&rThe beginning
Book4Page33=whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. &l9&rHe that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. &l10&rA reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. &l11&rAn evil man
Book4Page32=unpunished. &l6&rChildren's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. &l7&rExcellent speech becometh not a fool\: much less do lying lips a prince. &l8&rA gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it\:
Book4Page31=for silver, and the furnace for gold\: but the LORD trieth the hearts. &l4&rA wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. &l5&rWhoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker\: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be
Book4Page30=Chapter 17\nBetter is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. &l2&rA wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. &l3&rThe fining pot is
Book7Page50=not the bread of idleness. &l28&rHer children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. &l29&rMany daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
Book4Page29=glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. &l32&rHe that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. &l33&rThe lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.
Book4Page28=whisperer separateth chief friends. &l29&rA violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. &l30&rHe shutteth his eyes to devise froward things\: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. &l31&rThe hoary head is a crown of
Book4Page27=man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. &l26&rHe that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. &l27&rAn ungodly man diggeth up evil\: and in his lips there is as a burning fire. &l28&rA froward man soweth strife\: and a
Book4Page26=but the instruction of fools is folly. &l23&rThe heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. &l24&rPleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. &l25&rThere is a way that seemeth right unto a
Book4Page25=handleth a matter wisely shall find good\: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he. &l21&rThe wise in heart shall be called prudent\: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. &l22&rUnderstanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it\:
Book7Page49=girdles unto the merchant. &l25&rStrength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. &l26&rShe openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. &l27&rShe looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth
Book4Page24=depart from evil\: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. &l18&rPride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. &l19&rBetter it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. &l20&rHe that
Book7Page48=clothed with scarlet. &l22&rShe maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. &l23&rHer husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. &l24&rShe maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth
Book4Page23=it. &l15&rIn the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. &l16&rHow much better is it to get wisdom than gold\! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver\! &l17&rThe highway of the upright is to
Book7Page47=&l19&rShe layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. &l20&rShe stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. &l21&rShe is not afraid of the snow for her household\: for all her household are
Book4Page22=abomination to kings to commit wickedness\: for the throne is established by righteousness. &l13&rRighteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. &l14&rThe wrath of a king is as messengers of death\: but a wise man will pacify
Book7Page46=&l16&rShe considereth a field, and buyeth it\: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. &l17&rShe girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. &l18&rShe perceiveth that her merchandise is good\: her candle goeth not out by night.
Book4Page21=heart deviseth his way\: but the LORD directeth his steps. &l10&rA divine sentence is in the lips of the king\: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. &l11&rA just weight and balance are the LORD'S\: all the weights of the bag are his work. &l12&rIt is an
Book7Page45=&l13&rShe seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. &l14&rShe is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. &l15&rShe riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
Book4Page20=iniquity is purged\: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. &l7&rWhen a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. &l8&rBetter is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. &l9&rA man's
Book7Page44=the poor and needy. &l10&rWho can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. &l11&rThe heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. &l12&rShe will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
Book7Page43=that be of heavy hearts. &l7&rLet him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. &l8&rOpen thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. &l9&rOpen thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of
Book7Page42=for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink\: &l5&rLest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. &l6&rGive strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those
Book7Page41=Chapter 31\nThe words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. &l2&rWhat, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? &l3&rGive not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. &l4&rIt is not
Book7Page40=hand upon thy mouth. &l33&rSurely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood\: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
Book6Page9=Chapter 24\nBe not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. &l2&rFor their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. &l3&rThrough wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established\: &l4&rAnd by
Book6Page8=upon the top of a mast. &l35&rThey have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not\: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
Book6Page7=&l32&rAt the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. &l33&rThine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. &l34&rYea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth
Book6Page6=who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? &l30&rThey that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. &l31&rLook not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
Book6Page5=observe my ways. &l27&rFor a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. &l28&rShe also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. &l29&rWho hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling?
Book6Page4=&l24&rThe father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice\: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. &l25&rThy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. &l26&rMy son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes
Book6Page3=shall come to poverty\: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. &l22&rHearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. &l23&rBuy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
Book6Page2=&l18&rFor surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. &l19&rHear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. &l20&rBe not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh\: &l21&rFor the drunkard and the glutton
Book6Page1=Chapter 23 Cont.\nMy son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. &l16&rYea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. &l17&rLet not thine heart envy sinners\: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
Book4Page19=established. &l4&rThe LORD hath made all things for himself\: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. &l5&rEvery one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD\: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. &l6&rBy mercy and truth
Book4Page18=Chapter 16\nThe preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD. &l2&rAll the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. &l3&rCommit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
Book4Page17=understanding. &l33&rThe fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.
Book4Page16=&l30&rThe light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart\: and a good report maketh the bones fat. &l31&rThe ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. &l32&rHe that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul\: but he that heareth reproof getteth
Book7Page39=&l30&rA lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; &l31&rA greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. &l32&rIf thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine
Book4Page15=troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. &l28&rThe heart of the righteous studieth to answer\: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. &l29&rThe LORD is far from the wicked\: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.
Book7Page38=make they their houses in the rocks; &l27&rThe locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; &l28&rThe spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. &l29&rThere be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going\:
Book4Page14=beneath. &l25&rThe LORD will destroy the house of the proud\: but he will establish the border of the widow. &l26&rThe thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD\: but the words of the pure are pleasant words. &l27&rHe that is greedy of gain
Book7Page37=handmaid that is heir to her mistress. &l24&rThere be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise\: &l25&rThe ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; &l26&rThe conies are but a feeble folk, yet
Book4Page13=purposes are disappointed\: but in the multitude of counsellers they are established. &l23&rA man hath joy by the answer of his mouth\: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it\! &l24&rThe way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell
Book4Page12=thorns\: but the way of the righteous is made plain. &l20&rA wise son maketh a glad father\: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. &l21&rFolly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom\: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. &l22&rWithout counsel
Book7Page36=and saith, I have done no wickedness. &l21&rFor three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear\: &l22&rFor a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; &l23&rFor an odious woman when she is married; and an
Book7Page35=yea, four which I know not\: &l19&rThe way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. &l20&rSuch is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
Book4Page11=and trouble therewith. &l17&rBetter is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. &l18&rA wrathful man stirreth up strife\: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. &l19&rThe way of the slothful man is as an hedge of
Book4Page10=hath understanding seeketh knowledge\: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. &l15&rAll the days of the afflicted are evil\: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. &l16&rBetter is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
Book7Page34=the fire that saith not, It is enough. &l17&rThe eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. &l18&rThere be three things which are too wonderful for me,
Book7Page33=needy from among men. &l15&rThe horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough\: &l16&rThe grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and
Book7Page32=washed from their filthiness. &l13&rThere is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes\! and their eyelids are lifted up. &l14&rThere is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the
Book7Page31=&l10&rAccuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. &l11&rThere is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. &l12&rThere is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not
Book7Page30=&l8&rRemove far from me vanity and lies\: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me\: &l9&rLest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
Book7Page29=thou canst tell? &l5&rEvery word of God is pure\: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. &l6&rAdd thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. &l7&rTwo things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die\:
Book7Page28=knowledge of the holy. &l4&rWho hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if

Book7Page26=the LORD shall be safe. &l26&rMany seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD. &l27&rAn unjust man is an abomination to the just\: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.
Book7Page25=&l23&rA man's pride shall bring him low\: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. &l24&rWhoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul\: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. &l25&rThe fear of man bringeth a snare\: but whoso putteth his trust in
Book7Page24=is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. &l21&rHe that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. &l22&rAn angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
Book7Page23=yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. &l18&rWhere there is no vision, the people perish\: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. &l19&rA servant will not be corrected by words\: for though he understand he will not answer. &l20&rSeest thou a man that

Book7Page21=afterwards. &l12&rIf a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. &l13&rThe poor and the deceitful man meet together\: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. &l14&rThe king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
Book7Page20=turn away wrath. &l9&rIf a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. &l10&rThe bloodthirsty hate the upright\: but the just seek his soul. &l11&rA fool uttereth all his mind\: but a wise man keepeth it in till
Book7Page19=&l6&rIn the transgression of an evil man there is a snare\: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. &l7&rThe righteous considereth the cause of the poor\: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. &l8&rScornful men bring a city into a snare\: but wise men
Book7Page18=rejoiceth his father\: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. &l4&rThe king by judgment establisheth the land\: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. &l5&rA man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.
Book7Page17=Chapter 29\nHe, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. &l2&rWhen the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice\: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. &l3&rWhoso loveth wisdom
Book7Page16=&l27&rHe that giveth unto the poor shall not lack\: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. &l28&rWhen the wicked rise, men hide themselves\: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
Book7Page15=the same is the companion of a destroyer. &l25&rHe that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife\: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. &l26&rHe that trusteth in his own heart is a fool\: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

Book7Page13=poverty enough. &l20&rA faithful man shall abound with blessings\: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. &l21&rTo have respect of persons is not good\: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. &l22&rHe that hasteth to be rich
Book7Page12=shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. &l18&rWhoso walketh uprightly shall be saved\: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. &l19&rHe that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread\: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have
Book7Page11=lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. &l16&rThe prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor\: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. &l17&rA man that doeth violence to the blood of any person
