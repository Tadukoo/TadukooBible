Book17Page9=of the wicked shall perish.
Book17Page8=desire upon his enemies. &l9&rHe hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. &l10&rThe wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away\: the desire
Book17Page7=&l6&rSurely he shall not be moved for ever\: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. &l7&rHe shall not be afraid of evil tidings\: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. &l8&rHis heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his

Book17Page5=Chapter 112\nPraise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. &l2&rHis seed shall be mighty upon earth\: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. &l3&rWealth and riches shall be in his house\:
Book17Page4=his commandments\: his praise endureth for ever.
Book17Page3=ever, and are done in truth and uprightness. &l9&rHe sent redemption unto his people\: he hath commanded his covenant for ever\: holy and reverend is his name. &l10&rThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom\: a good understanding have all they that do
Book17Page2=ever be mindful of his covenant. &l6&rHe hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. &l7&rThe works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. &l8&rThey stand fast for ever and
Book17Page1=Chapter 111 Cont.\nHis work is honourable and glorious\: and his righteousness endureth for ever. &l4&rHe hath made his wonderful works to be remembered\: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. &l5&rHe hath given meat unto them that fear him\: he will
Book20Page50=their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. &l9&rI will sing a new song unto thee, O God\: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
Book21Page35=ye the LORD.
Book21Page34=psaltery and harp. &l4&rPraise him with the timbrel and dance\: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. &l5&rPraise him upon the loud cymbals\: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. &l6&rLet every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise
Book20Page49=they shall smoke. &l6&rCast forth lightning, and scatter them\: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. &l7&rSend thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; &l8&rWhose mouth speaketh vanity, and
Book21Page33=Chapter 150\nPraise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary\: praise him in the firmament of his power. &l2&rPraise him for his mighty acts\: praise him according to his excellent greatness. &l3&rPraise him with the sound of the trumpet\: praise him with the
Book20Page48=&l3&rLORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him\! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him\! &l4&rMan is like to vanity\: his days are as a shadow that passeth away. &l5&rBow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down\: touch the mountains, and
Book21Page32=this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
Book20Page47=Chapter 144\nA Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight\: &l2&rMy goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
Book21Page31=be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; &l7&rTo execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; &l8&rTo bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; &l9&rTo execute upon them the judgment written\:
Book20Page46=mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul\: for I am thy servant.
Book21Page30=them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. &l4&rFor the LORD taketh pleasure in his people\: he will beautify the meek with salvation. &l5&rLet the saints be joyful in glory\: let them sing aloud upon their beds. &l6&rLet the high praises of God
Book20Page45=unto thee to hide me. &l10&rTeach me to do thy will; for thou art my God\: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. &l11&rQuicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake\: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. &l12&rAnd of thy
Book20Page44=like unto them that go down into the pit. &l8&rCause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust\: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. &l9&rDeliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies\: I flee
Book20Page43=of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. &l6&rI stretch forth my hands unto thee\: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. &l7&rHear me speedily, O LORD\: my spirit faileth\: hide not thy face from me, lest I be
Book20Page42=enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. &l4&rTherefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. &l5&rI remember the days
Book20Page41=Chapter 143\nA Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications\: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. &l2&rAnd enter not into judgment with thy servant\: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. &l3&rFor the
Book20Page40=praise thy name\: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
Book21Page29=Chapter 149\nPraise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. &l2&rLet Israel rejoice in him that made him\: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. &l3&rLet them praise his name in the dance\: let
Book21Page28=&l14&rHe also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
Book21Page27=&l11&rKings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth\: &l12&rBoth young men, and maidens; old men, and children\: &l13&rLet them praise the name of the LORD\: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
Book21Page26=the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps\: &l8&rFire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word\: &l9&rMountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars\: &l10&rBeasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl\:
Book21Page25=heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. &l5&rLet them praise the name of the LORD\: for he commanded, and they were created. &l6&rHe hath also stablished them for ever and ever\: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. &l7&rPraise
Book21Page24=Chapter 148\nPraise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens\: praise him in the heights. &l2&rPraise ye him, all his angels\: praise ye him, all his hosts. &l3&rPraise ye him, sun and moon\: praise him, all ye stars of light. &l4&rPraise him, ye
Book20Page39=cried unto thee, O LORD\: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. &l6&rAttend unto my cry; for I am brought very low\: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. &l7&rBring my soul out of prison, that I may
Book21Page23=&l19&rHe sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. &l20&rHe hath not dealt so with any nation\: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
Book20Page38=overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. &l4&rI looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me\: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. &l5&rI
Book21Page22=swiftly. &l16&rHe giveth snow like wool\: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. &l17&rHe casteth forth his ice like morsels\: who can stand before his cold? &l18&rHe sendeth out his word, and melteth them\: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
Book20Page37=Chapter 142\nMaschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave. I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. &l2&rI poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. &l3&rWhen my spirit was
Book21Page21=&l13&rFor he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. &l14&rHe maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. &l15&rHe sendeth forth his commandment upon earth\: his word runneth very
Book20Page36=workers of iniquity. &l10&rLet the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
Book21Page20=which cry. &l10&rHe delighteth not in the strength of the horse\: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. &l11&rThe LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. &l12&rPraise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
Book20Page35=at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. &l8&rBut mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord\: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. &l9&rKeep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the
Book20Page34=reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head\: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. &l6&rWhen their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. &l7&rOur bones are scattered
Book20Page33=LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. &l4&rIncline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity\: and let me not eat of their dainties. &l5&rLet the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness\: and let him
Book20Page32=Chapter 141\nA Psalm of David. LORD, I cry unto thee\: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. &l2&rLet my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. &l3&rSet a watch, O
Book20Page31=and the right of the poor. &l13&rSurely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name\: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
Book20Page30=let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. &l11&rLet not an evil speaker be established in the earth\: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. &l12&rI know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
Book21Page19=unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God\: &l8&rWho covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. &l9&rHe giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens
Book21Page18=their wounds. &l4&rHe telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. &l5&rGreat is our Lord, and of great power\: his understanding is infinite. &l6&rThe LORD lifteth up the meek\: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. &l7&rSing
Book21Page17=Chapter 147\nPraise ye the LORD\: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. &l2&rThe LORD doth build up Jerusalem\: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. &l3&rHe healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up
Book21Page16=&l9&rThe LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow\: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. &l10&rThe LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
Book21Page15=keepeth truth for ever\: &l7&rWhich executeth judgment for the oppressed\: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners\: &l8&rThe LORD openeth the eyes of the blind\: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down\: the LORD loveth the righteous\:
Book21Page14=breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. &l5&rHappy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God\: &l6&rWhich made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is\: which
Book20Page29=&l8&rGrant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked\: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah. &l9&rAs for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. &l10&rLet burning coals fall upon them\:
Book21Page13=Chapter 146\nPraise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. &l2&rWhile I live will I praise the LORD\: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. &l3&rPut not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. &l4&rHis
Book20Page28=spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. &l6&rI said unto the LORD, Thou art my God\: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD. &l7&rO GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
Book21Page12=shall speak the praise of the LORD\: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
Book20Page27=tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah. &l4&rKeep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. &l5&rThe proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have
Book21Page11=call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. &l19&rHe will fulfil the desire of them that fear him\: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. &l20&rThe LORD preserveth all them that love him\: but all the wicked will he destroy. &l21&rMy mouth
Book20Page26=Chapter 140\nTo the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man\: preserve me from the violent man; &l2&rWhich imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war. &l3&rThey have sharpened their
Book21Page10=wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. &l16&rThou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. &l17&rThe LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. &l18&rThe LORD is nigh unto all them that
Book20Page25=those that rise up against thee? &l22&rI hate them with perfect hatred\: I count them mine enemies. &l23&rSearch me, O God, and know my heart\: try me, and know my thoughts\: &l24&rAnd see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
Book20Page24=thee. &l19&rSurely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God\: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. &l20&rFor they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. &l21&rDo not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with
Book20Page23=in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. &l17&rHow precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God\! how great is the sum of them\! &l18&rIf I should count them, they are more in number than the sand\: when I awake, I am still with
Book20Page22=knoweth right well. &l15&rMy substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. &l16&rThine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which
Book20Page21=the day\: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. &l13&rFor thou hast possessed my reins\: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. &l14&rI will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made\: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul
Book20Page20=parts of the sea; &l10&rEven there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. &l11&rIf I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. &l12&rYea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as
Book20Page19=it. &l7&rWhither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? &l8&rIf I ascend up into heaven, thou art there\: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. &l9&rIf I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
Book20Page18=with all my ways. &l4&rFor there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. &l5&rThou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. &l6&rSuch knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto
Book2Page50=is broken by mine arms. &l35&rThou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation\: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. &l36&rThou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
Book20Page17=Chapter 139\nTo the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. &l2&rThou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. &l3&rThou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
Book20Page16=the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. &l8&rThe LORD will perfect that which concerneth me\: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever\: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
Book20Page15=the LORD\: for great is the glory of the LORD. &l6&rThough the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly\: but the proud he knoweth afar off. &l7&rThough I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me\: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against
Book20Page14=above all thy name. &l3&rIn the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. &l4&rAll the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. &l5&rYea, they shall sing in the ways of
Book20Page13=Chapter 138\nA Psalm of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart\: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. &l2&rI will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth\: for thou hast magnified thy word
Book20Page12=shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. &l9&rHappy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
Book20Page11=roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. &l7&rRemember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. &l8&rO daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy
Book20Page10=required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. &l4&rHow shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land? &l5&rIf I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. &l6&rIf I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the
Book2Page49=save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? &l32&rIt is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. &l33&rHe maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. &l34&rHe teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel
Book2Page48=God will enlighten my darkness. &l29&rFor by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. &l30&rAs for God, his way is perfect\: the word of the LORD is tried\: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. &l31&rFor who is God
Book15Page50=not for his counsel\: &l14&rBut lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. &l15&rAnd he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. &l16&rThey envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
Book2Page47=wilt shew thyself upright; &l26&rWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. &l27&rFor thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. &l28&rFor thou wilt light my candle\: the LORD my
Book2Page46=him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. &l24&rTherefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. &l25&rWith the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou
Book2Page45=cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. &l21&rFor I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. &l22&rFor all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. &l23&rI was also upright before
Book2Page44=&l18&rThey prevented me in the day of my calamity\: but the LORD was my stay. &l19&rHe brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. &l20&rThe LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
Book2Page43=discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. &l16&rHe sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. &l17&rHe delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me\: for they were too strong for me.
Book2Page42=the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. &l14&rYea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. &l15&rThen the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were
Book2Page41=darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. &l12&rAt the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. &l13&rThe LORD also thundered in the heavens, and
Book2Page40=nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured\: coals were kindled by it. &l9&rHe bowed the heavens also, and came down\: and darkness was under his feet. &l10&rAnd he rode upon a cherub, and did fly\: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. &l11&rHe made
Book1Page50=his enemies, he puffeth at them. &l6&rHe hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved\: for I shall never be in adversity. &l7&rHis mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud\: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
Book15Page49=hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. &l11&rAnd the waters covered their enemies\: there was not one of them left. &l12&rThen believed they his words; they sang his praise. &l13&rThey soon forgat his works; they waited
Book15Page48=sea. &l8&rNevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. &l9&rHe rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up\: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. &l10&rAnd he saved them from the
Book15Page47=thine inheritance. &l6&rWe have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. &l7&rOur fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red
Book15Page46=righteousness at all times. &l4&rRemember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people\: O visit me with thy salvation; &l5&rThat I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with
Book15Page45=Chapter 106\nPraise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good\: for his mercy endureth for ever. &l2&rWho can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? &l3&rBlessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
Book15Page44=&l45&rThat they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
Book15Page43=like a river. &l42&rFor he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. &l43&rAnd he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness\: &l44&rAnd gave them the lands of the heathen\: and they inherited the labour of the people;
Book15Page42=them. &l39&rHe spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. &l40&rThe people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. &l41&rHe opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places
Book2Page39=unto my God\: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. &l7&rThen the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. &l8&rThere went up a smoke out of his
Book15Page41=also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. &l37&rHe brought them forth also with silver and gold\: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. &l38&rEgypt was glad when they departed\: for the fear of them fell upon
Book2Page38=shall I be saved from mine enemies. &l4&rThe sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. &l5&rThe sorrows of hell compassed me about\: the snares of death prevented me. &l6&rIn my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried
Book15Page40=vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. &l34&rHe spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, &l35&rAnd did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. &l36&rHe smote
Book2Page37=thee, O LORD, my strength. &l2&rThe LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. &l3&rI will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised\: so
Book2Page36=Chapter 18\n &l1&rTo the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul\: And he said, I will love
Book2Page35=treasure\: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. &l15&rAs for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness\: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
Book1Page49=and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth. &l4&rThe wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God\: God is not in all his thoughts. &l5&rHis ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight\: as for all
Book2Page34=&l13&rArise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down\: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword\: &l14&rFrom men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid
Book1Page48=Chapter 10\nWhy standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? &l2&rThe wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor\: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. &l3&rFor the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
Book14Page50=me. &l9&rFor I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, &l10&rBecause of thine indignation and thy wrath\: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. &l11&rMy days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
Book2Page33=their own fat\: with their mouth they speak proudly. &l11&rThey have now compassed us in our steps\: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; &l12&rLike as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Book1Page47=thy sight. &l20&rPut them in fear, O LORD\: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.

Book2Page3=God, lift up thine hand\: forget not the humble. &l13&rWherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. &l14&rThou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand\: the poor

Book11Page50=and greatly abhorred Israel\: &l60&rSo that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; &l61&rAnd delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Book11Page49=turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers\: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. &l58&rFor they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. &l59&rWhen God heard this, he was wroth,

Book11Page47=sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. &l53&rAnd he led them on safely, so that they feared not\: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. &l54&rAnd he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand
Book11Page46=made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; &l51&rAnd smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham\: &l52&rBut made his own people to go forth like
Book11Page45=their sycomore trees with frost. &l48&rHe gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. &l49&rHe cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. &l50&rHe
Book11Page44=could not drink. &l45&rHe sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. &l46&rHe gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. &l47&rHe destroyed their vines with hail, and
Book11Page43=Israel. &l42&rThey remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. &l43&rHow he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan\: &l44&rAnd had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they

Book18Page8=with my whole heart\: be merciful unto me according to thy word. &l59&rI thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. &l60&rI made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. &l61&rThe bands of the wicked have robbed me\: but I have not

Book18Page7=of my pilgrimage. &l55&rI have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. &l56&rThis I had, because I kept thy precepts. &l57&rCHETH. Thou art my portion, O LORD\: I have said that I would keep thy words. &l58&rI intreated thy favour
Book18Page6=derision\: yet have I not declined from thy law. &l52&rI remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. &l53&rHorror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. &l54&rThy statutes have been my songs in the house
Book18Page5=have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. &l49&rZAIN. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. &l50&rThis is my comfort in my affliction\: for thy word hath quickened me. &l51&rThe proud have had me greatly in
Book18Page4=liberty\: for I seek thy precepts. &l46&rI will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. &l47&rAnd I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. &l48&rMy hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I

Book18Page2=reproach which I fear\: for thy judgments are good. &l40&rBehold, I have longed after thy precepts\: quicken me in thy righteousness. &l41&rVAU. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word. &l42&rSo shall I have
Book10Page50=this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. &l3&rLift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. &l4&rThine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
Book18Page1=Chapter 119 Cont.\nIncline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. &l37&rTurn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way. &l38&rStablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. &l39&rTurn away my
Book11Page39=slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. &l32&rFor all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. &l33&rTherefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. &l34&rWhen he slew them, then
Book11Page38=camp, round about their habitations. &l29&rSo they did eat, and were well filled\: for he gave them their own desire; &l30&rThey were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, &l31&rThe wrath of God came upon them, and
Book11Page37=to the full. &l26&rHe caused an east wind to blow in the heaven\: and by his power he brought in the south wind. &l27&rHe rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea\: &l28&rAnd he let it fall in the midst of their
Book11Page36=trusted not in his salvation\: &l23&rThough he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, &l24&rAnd had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. &l25&rMan did eat angels' food\: he sent them meat
Book11Page35=streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? &l21&rTherefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth\: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; &l22&rBecause they believed not in God, and
Book11Page34=High in the wilderness. &l18&rAnd they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. &l19&rYea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? &l20&rBehold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
Book10Page49=Chapter 74\nMaschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? &l2&rRemember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed;
Book11Page33=fire. &l15&rHe clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. &l16&rHe brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. &l17&rAnd they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
Book10Page48=them that go a whoring from thee. &l28&rBut it is good for me to draw near to God\: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
Book11Page32=sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. &l13&rHe divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. &l14&rIn the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of
Book10Page47=heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. &l26&rMy flesh and my heart faileth\: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. &l27&rFor, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish\: thou hast destroyed all
Book11Page31=Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. &l10&rThey kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; &l11&rAnd forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. &l12&rMarvellous things did he in the
Book10Page46=&l22&rSo foolish was I, and ignorant\: I was as a beast before thee. &l23&rNevertheless I am continually with thee\: thou hast holden me by my right hand. &l24&rThou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. &l25&rWhom have I in
Book11Page30=God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments\: &l8&rAnd might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. &l9&rThe children of
Book10Page45=they brought into desolation, as in a moment\! they are utterly consumed with terrors. &l20&rAs a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. &l21&rThus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
Book10Page44=children. &l16&rWhen I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; &l17&rUntil I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end. &l18&rSurely thou didst set them in slippery places\: thou castedst them down into destruction. &l19&rHow are
Book10Page43=riches. &l13&rVerily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. &l14&rFor all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. &l15&rIf I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy

Book10Page41=&l7&rTheir eyes stand out with fatness\: they have more than heart could wish. &l8&rThey are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression\: they speak loftily. &l9&rThey set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
Book10Page40=&l4&rFor there are no bands in their death\: but their strength is firm. &l5&rThey are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. &l6&rTherefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
Book11Page29=commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children\: &l6&rThat the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children\: &l7&rThat they might set their hope in
Book11Page28=&l4&rWe will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. &l5&rFor he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he

Book11Page23=surely I will remember thy wonders of old. &l12&rI will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. &l13&rThy way, O God, is in the sanctuary\: who is so great a God as our God? &l14&rThou art the God that doest wonders\: thou hast declared thy

Book7Page45=Chapter 52\n &l1&rTo the chief Musician, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth
Book7Page44=pleasure unto Zion\: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. &l19&rThen shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering\: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
Book7Page43=forth thy praise. &l16&rFor thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it\: thou delightest not in burnt offering. &l17&rThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit\: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. &l18&rDo good in thy good
Book7Page42=I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. &l14&rDeliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation\: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. &l15&rO Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew
Book7Page41=&l10&rCreate in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. &l11&rCast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. &l12&rRestore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. &l13&rThen will
Book7Page40=&l7&rPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean\: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. &l8&rMake me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. &l9&rHide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

Book7Page39=be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. &l5&rBehold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. &l6&rBehold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts\: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

Book7Page37=Chapter 51\n &l1&rTo the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness\: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my

Book7Page33=my covenant in thy mouth? &l17&rSeeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. &l18&rWhen thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. &l19&rThou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue
Book6Page48=and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. &l5&rThine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. &l6&rThy throne, O God, is for ever and ever\: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right

Book7Page31=fowls of the mountains\: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. &l12&rIf I were hungry, I would not tell thee\: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. &l13&rWill I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? &l14&rOffer unto God

Book6Page44=Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. &l24&rWherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? &l25&rFor our soul is bowed down to the dust\: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. &l26&rArise for our help, and redeem us for thy

Book6Page42=in thy covenant. &l18&rOur heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; &l19&rThough thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. &l20&rIf we have forgotten the name of our God, or
Book6Page41=continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, &l16&rFor the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. &l17&rAll this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely
Book6Page40=increase thy wealth by their price. &l13&rThou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. &l14&rThou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. &l15&rMy confusion is
Book5Page50=desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. &l10&rMy heart panteth, my strength faileth me\: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. &l11&rMy lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
