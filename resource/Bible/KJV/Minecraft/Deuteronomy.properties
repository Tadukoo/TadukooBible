Book11Page29=another land, as it is this day. &l29&rThe secret things belong unto the LORD our God\: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
Book11Page28=them\: &l27&rAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book\: &l28&rAnd the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into
Book11Page27=forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt\: &l26&rFor they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto
Book11Page26=Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath\: &l24&rEven all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? &l25&rThen men shall say, Because they have
Book11Page25=plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; &l23&rAnd that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and
Book11Page24=Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law\: &l22&rSo that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the
Book11Page23=the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven. &l21&rAnd the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of
Book11Page22=come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst\: &l20&rThe LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of
Book11Page21=&l18&rLest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; &l19&rAnd it
Book11Page20=with us this day\: &l16&r(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by; &l17&rAnd ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them\:)
Book11Page19=as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. &l14&rNeither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; &l15&rBut with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here
Book11Page18=shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day\: &l13&rThat he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and
Book11Page17=the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel, &l11&rYour little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water\: &l12&rThat thou
Book11Page16=land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. &l9&rKeep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do. &l10&rYe stand this day all of you before
Book11Page15=have ye drunk wine or strong drink\: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God. &l7&rAnd when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them\: &l8&rAnd we took their
Book11Page14=you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day. &l5&rAnd I have led you forty years in the wilderness\: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. &l6&rYe have not eaten bread, neither
Book11Page13=seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; &l3&rThe great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles\: &l4&rYet the LORD hath not given
Book11Page12=Chapter 29\nThese are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. &l2&rAnd Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
Book11Page11=&l68&rAnd the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again\: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.
Book11Page10=none assurance of thy life\: &l67&rIn the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even\! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning\! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
Book2Page50=Chapter 5\nAnd Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. &l2&rThe LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Book4Page9=for the good land which he hath given thee. &l11&rBeware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day\: &l12&rLest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast
Book4Page8=&l9&rA land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. &l10&rWhen thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God
Book4Page7=&l7&rFor the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; &l8&rA land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
Book4Page6=swell, these forty years. &l5&rThou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. &l6&rTherefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
Book2Page49=&l48&rFrom Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, &l49&rAnd all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
Book4Page5=knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. &l4&rThy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
Book2Page48=Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt\: &l47&rAnd they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
Book4Page4=thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. &l3&rAnd he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou
Book2Page47=testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt, &l46&rOn this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at
Book4Page3=Chapter 8\nAll the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. &l2&rAnd thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
Book2Page46=&l43&rNamely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites. &l44&rAnd this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel\: &l45&rThese are the
Book4Page2=bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it\: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.
Book2Page45=&l41&rThen Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; &l42&rThat the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live\:
Book4Page1=Chapter 7 Cont.\nThe graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire\: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein\: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. &l26&rNeither shalt thou
Book2Page44=&l40&rThou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
Book2Page43=than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. &l39&rKnow therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath\: there is none else.
Book2Page42=his words out of the midst of the fire. &l37&rAnd because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; &l38&rTo drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
Book2Page41=&l35&rUnto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him. &l36&rOut of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee\: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest
Book2Page40=take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
Book2Page39=unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? &l33&rDid ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? &l34&rOr hath God assayed to go and
Book2Page38=forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. &l32&rFor ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven
Book2Page37=with all thy soul. &l30&rWhen thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; &l31&r(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not
Book2Page36=lead you. &l28&rAnd there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. &l29&rBut if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and
Book2Page35=land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. &l27&rAnd the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall
Book2Page34=yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger\: &l26&rI call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the
Book2Page33=any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. &l24&rFor the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. &l25&rWhen thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
Book2Page32=must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan\: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. &l23&rTake heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of
Book2Page31=of inheritance, as ye are this day. &l21&rFurthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance\: &l22&rBut I
Book2Page30=shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. &l20&rBut the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people
Book2Page29=likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth\: &l19&rAnd lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven,
Book2Page28=the fire\: &l16&rLest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, &l17&rThe likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, &l18&rThe
Book2Page27=teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. &l15&rTake ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of
Book2Page26=of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. &l13&rAnd he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. &l14&rAnd the LORD commanded me at that time to
Book2Page25=their children. &l11&rAnd ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. &l12&rAnd the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire\: ye heard the voice
Book2Page24=day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach
Book2Page23=this day? &l9&rOnly take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life\: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; &l10&rSpecially the
Book2Page22=what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? &l8&rAnd what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
Book2Page21=whither ye go to possess it. &l6&rKeep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. &l7&rFor
Book2Page20=God hath destroyed them from among you. &l4&rBut ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day. &l5&rBehold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
Book2Page19=which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. &l3&rYour eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor\: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy
Book2Page18=Chapter 4\nNow therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. &l2&rYe shall not add unto the word
Book2Page17=charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him\: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. &l29&rSo we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
Book2Page16=suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. &l27&rGet thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes\: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. &l28&rBut
Book2Page15=and according to thy might? &l25&rI pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. &l26&rBut the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me\: and the LORD said unto me, Let it
Book2Page14=your God he shall fight for you. &l23&rAnd I besought the LORD at that time, saying, &l24&rO Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand\: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works,
Book2Page13=I have given you. &l21&rAnd I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings\: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. &l22&rYe shall not fear them\: for the LORD
Book2Page12=which I have given you; &l20&rUntil the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan\: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which
Book2Page11=this land to possess it\: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. &l19&rBut your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities
Book2Page10=children of Ammon; &l17&rThe plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. &l18&rAnd I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you
Book5Page9=land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. &l15&rAnd I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. &l16&rTake heed to yourselves, that
Book5Page8=year. &l13&rAnd it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, &l14&rThat I will give you the rain of your
Book5Page7=whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven\: &l12&rA land which the LORD thy God careth for\: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the
Book5Page6=land that floweth with milk and honey. &l10&rFor the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs\: &l11&rBut the land,
Book5Page5=commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; &l9&rAnd that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a
Book5Page4=swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel\: &l7&rBut your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did. &l8&rTherefore shall ye keep all the
Book5Page3=you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day; &l5&rAnd what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; &l6&rAnd what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben\: how the earth opened her mouth, and
Book5Page2=which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; &l4&rAnd what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after
Book5Page1=Chapter 11 Cont.\nAnd know ye this day\: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, &l3&rAnd his miracles, and his acts,
Book6Page50=LORD empty\: &l17&rEvery man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.
Book6Page49=rejoice. &l16&rThree times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles\: and they shall not appear before the
Book6Page48=gates. &l15&rSeven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose\: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely
Book6Page47=that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine\: &l14&rAnd thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy
Book6Page46=you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there. &l12&rAnd thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt\: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. &l13&rThou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
Book6Page45=blessed thee\: &l11&rAnd thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among
Book6Page44=time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn. &l10&rAnd thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath
Book6Page43=go unto thy tents. &l8&rSix days thou shalt eat unleavened bread\: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God\: thou shalt do no work therein. &l9&rSeven weeks shalt thou number unto thee\: begin to number the seven weeks from such
Book6Page42=there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. &l7&rAnd thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose\: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and
Book6Page41=sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. &l5&rThou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee\: &l6&rBut at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in,
Book6Page40=haste\: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. &l4&rAnd there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou
Book6Page39=the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there. &l3&rThou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
Book6Page38=Chapter 16\nObserve the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God\: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. &l2&rThou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and
Book6Page37=thy God. &l22&rThou shalt eat it within thy gates\: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart. &l23&rOnly thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.
Book6Page36=shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household. &l21&rAnd if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD
Book6Page35=bless thee in all that thou doest. &l19&rAll the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God\: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. &l20&rThou
Book6Page34=ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise. &l18&rIt shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years\: and the LORD thy God shall
Book6Page33=&l16&rAnd it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; &l17&rThen thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for
Book6Page32=winepress\: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. &l15&rAnd thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee\: therefore I command thee this thing to day.
Book6Page31=then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. &l13&rAnd when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty\: &l14&rThou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy
Book6Page30=cease out of the land\: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land. &l12&rAnd if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years;
Book6Page29=&l10&rThou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him\: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto. &l11&rFor the poor shall never
Book6Page28=that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.
Book6Page27=which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother\: &l8&rBut thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth. &l9&rBeware
Book6Page26=promised thee\: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee. &l7&rIf there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land
Book6Page25=LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it\: &l5&rOnly if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day. &l6&rFor the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he
Book6Page24=is called the LORD'S release. &l3&rOf a foreigner thou mayest exact it again\: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release; &l4&rSave when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the
Book6Page23=Chapter 15\nAt the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. &l2&rAnd this is the manner of the release\: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
Book6Page22=thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.
Book6Page21=for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee. &l28&rAt the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates\: &l29&rAnd the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
Book6Page20=sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth\: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, &l27&rAnd the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him;

Book1Page26=&l44&rAnd the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah. &l45&rAnd ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear
Book1Page25=Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. &l43&rSo I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.
Book1Page24=and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. &l42&rAnd the LORD said unto me,

Book13Page16=the plains of Moab thirty days\: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. &l9&rAnd Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him\: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the
Book13Page15=land of Moab, over against Bethpeor\: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. &l7&rAnd Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died\: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. &l8&rAnd the children of Israel wept for Moses in

Book13Page13=all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, &l3&rAnd the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. &l4&rAnd the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I
Book13Page12=Chapter 34\nAnd Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, &l2&rAnd all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
Book13Page11=liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
Book13Page10=shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. &l29&rHappy art thou, O Israel\: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency\! and thine enemies shall be found
Book4Page50=Chapter 11\nTherefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.
Book4Page49=thine eyes have seen. &l22&rThy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Book4Page48=strangers in the land of Egypt. &l20&rThou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. &l21&rHe is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which
Book4Page47=great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward\: &l18&rHe doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. &l19&rLove ye therefore the stranger\: for ye were
Book4Page46=fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. &l16&rCircumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. &l17&rFor the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a

Book4Page44=their fathers to give unto them. &l12&rAnd now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, &l13&rTo
Book11Page9=find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest\: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind\: &l66&rAnd thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have
Book4Page43=forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee. &l11&rAnd the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto
Book11Page8=&l64&rAnd the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone. &l65&rAnd among these nations shalt thou

Book11Page7=shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
Book4Page41=his stead. &l7&rFrom thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. &l8&rAt that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister
Book11Page6=in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. &l62&rAnd ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God. &l63&rAnd it
Book4Page40=had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me. &l6&rAnd the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera\: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in
Book11Page5=long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. &l60&rMoreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. &l61&rAlso every sickness, and every plague, which is not written
Book11Page4=not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; &l59&rThen the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of
Book11Page3=young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear\: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. &l58&rIf thou wilt

Book4Page39=writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly\: and the LORD gave them unto me. &l5&rAnd I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I
Book4Page38=brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. &l3&rAnd I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. &l4&rAnd he wrote on the tables, according to the first
Book4Page37=Chapter 10\nAt that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. &l2&rAnd I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou

Book4Page35=their wickedness, nor to their sin\: &l28&rLest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
Book4Page34=thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. &l27&rRemember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to
Book4Page33=LORD from the day that I knew you. &l25&rThus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you. &l26&rI prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not
Book4Page32=the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. &l24&rYe have been rebellious against the
Book4Page31=it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust\: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. &l22&rAnd at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath. &l23&rLikewise when
Book4Page30=you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also. &l20&rAnd the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him\: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. &l21&rAnd I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped
Book4Page29=neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. &l19&rFor I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy
Book4Page28=aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you. &l17&rAnd I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. &l18&rAnd I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights\: I did
Book4Page27=&l15&rSo I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire\: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. &l16&rAnd I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf\: ye had turned
Book4Page26=LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people\: &l14&rLet me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven\: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
Book4Page25=me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. &l13&rFurthermore the
Book4Page24=with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. &l11&rAnd it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. &l12&rAnd the LORD said unto
Book4Page23=I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water\: &l10&rAnd the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake
Book4Page22=the LORD. &l8&rAlso in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you. &l9&rWhen I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then
Book4Page21=for thou art a stiffnecked people. &l7&rRemember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness\: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against

Book4Page19=land\: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee. &l5&rNot for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land\: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God
Book4Page18=thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee. &l4&rSpeak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this
Book4Page17=thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak\! &l3&rUnderstand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face\: so shalt

Book4Page12=of flint; &l16&rWho fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; &l17&rAnd thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath
Book4Page11=thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; &l15&rWho led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock
Book4Page10=built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; &l13&rAnd when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; &l14&rThen thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought
Book12Page9=many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed\: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into

Book12Page6=troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us? &l18&rAnd I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
Book12Page5=among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. &l17&rThen my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and

Book13Page3=blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. &l17&rHis glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns\: with them he shall push the people together
Book13Page2=forth by the moon, &l15&rAnd for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, &l16&rAnd for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush\: let the
Book8Page19=wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated\: &l16&rThen it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the
Book13Page1=Chapter 33 Cont.\nAnd of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, &l14&rAnd for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put
Book8Page18=thy wife. &l14&rAnd it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her. &l15&rIf a man have two
Book8Page17=head, and pare her nails; &l13&rAnd she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month\: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be
Book8Page16=them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, &l11&rAnd seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; &l12&rThen thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her
Book8Page15=shall be forgiven them. &l9&rSo shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. &l10&rWhen thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered
Book8Page14=&l7&rAnd they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. &l8&rBe merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood
Book8Page13=him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried\: &l6&rAnd all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley\:
Book8Page12=city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley\: &l5&rAnd the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto
Book12Page49=&l10&rThey shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law\: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. &l11&rBless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands\: smite through the loins of them that rise
Book8Page11=are round about him that is slain\: &l3&rAnd it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; &l4&rAnd the elders of that
Book12Page48=and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; &l9&rWho said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children\: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
Book8Page10=Chapter 21\nIf one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him\: &l2&rThen thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which
Book12Page47=Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people\: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies. &l8&rAnd of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah,
Book12Page46=the congregation of Jacob. &l5&rAnd he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. &l6&rLet Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few. &l7&rAnd this is the blessing of Judah\: and he said,
Book12Page45=thousands of saints\: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. &l3&rYea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand\: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words. &l4&rMoses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of
Book12Page44=Chapter 33\nAnd this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. &l2&rAnd he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten
Book12Page43=of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. &l52&rYet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
Book12Page42=for a possession\: &l50&rAnd die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people\: &l51&rBecause ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters
Book12Page41=&l48&rAnd the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, &l49&rGet thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel
Book12Page40=which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. &l47&rFor it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life\: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
Book12Page39=the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. &l45&rAnd Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel\: &l46&rAnd he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day,
Book12Page38=of revenges upon the enemy. &l43&rRejoice, O ye nations, with his people\: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people. &l44&rAnd Moses came and spake all
Book12Page37=take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. &l42&rI will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning
Book12Page36=I, am he, and there is no god with me\: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal\: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. &l40&rFor I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. &l41&rIf I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand
Book12Page35=&l37&rAnd he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, &l38&rWhich did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection. &l39&rSee now that I, even
Book12Page34=for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. &l36&rFor the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.
Book12Page33=clusters are bitter\: &l33&rTheir wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. &l34&rIs not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? &l35&rTo me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time\:
Book12Page32=their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? &l31&rFor their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. &l32&rFor their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah\: their grapes are grapes of gall, their
Book12Page31=are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. &l29&rO that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end\! &l30&rHow should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except
Book12Page30=remembrance of them to cease from among men\: &l27&rWere it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this. &l28&rFor they
Book12Page29=them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. &l25&rThe sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs. &l26&rI said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
Book12Page28=fire the foundations of the mountains. &l23&rI will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. &l24&rThey shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction\: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
Book12Page27=I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. &l22&rFor a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on
Book12Page26=will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be\: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. &l21&rThey have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities\: and
Book12Page25=whom your fathers feared not. &l18&rOf the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee. &l19&rAnd when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. &l20&rAnd he said, I
Book12Page24=and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. &l16&rThey provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. &l17&rThey sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up,
Book12Page23=Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. &l15&rBut Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked\: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him,
Book12Page22=made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; &l14&rButter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of
Book12Page21=kept him as the apple of his eye. &l11&rAs an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings\: &l12&rSo the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. &l13&rHe
Book12Page20=the people according to the number of the children of Israel. &l9&rFor the LORD'S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. &l10&rHe found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he
Book12Page19=the days of old, consider the years of many generations\: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. &l8&rWhen the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of
Book12Page18=their spot is not the spot of his children\: they are a perverse and crooked generation. &l6&rDo ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee? &l7&rRemember
Book12Page17=&l3&rBecause I will publish the name of the LORD\: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. &l4&rHe is the Rock, his work is perfect\: for all his ways are judgment\: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. &l5&rThey have corrupted themselves,
Book12Page16=Chapter 32\nGive ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. &l2&rMy doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass\:
Book12Page15=anger through the work of your hands. &l30&rAnd Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
Book12Page14=against them. &l29&rFor I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
Book12Page13=yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? &l28&rGather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record
Book12Page12=covenant of the LORD, saying, &l26&rTake this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. &l27&rFor I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck\: behold, while I am
Book7Page50=the battle, and another man eat of it. &l7&rAnd what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
Book12Page11=the land which I sware unto them\: and I will be with thee. &l24&rAnd it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, &l25&rThat Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
Book12Page10=the land which I sware. &l22&rMoses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. &l23&rAnd he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage\: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into
Book2Page9=Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. &l15&rAnd I gave Gilead unto Machir. &l16&rAnd unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
Book2Page8=the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. &l14&rJair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
Book2Page7=land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. &l13&rAnd the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto
Book2Page6=king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. &l12&rAnd this
Book2Page5=of Arnon unto mount Hermon; &l9&r(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) &l10&rAll the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. &l11&rFor only Og
Book2Page4=women, and children, of every city. &l7&rBut all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. &l8&rAnd we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river
Book2Page3=region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. &l5&rAll these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. &l6&rAnd we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men,
Book7Page49=hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. &l6&rAnd what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in
Book2Page2=delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people\: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. &l4&rAnd we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the
Book7Page48=neither be ye terrified because of them; &l4&rFor the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. &l5&rAnd the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and
Book2Page1=Chapter 3 Cont.\nAnd the LORD said unto me, Fear him not\: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. &l3&rSo the LORD our God
Book7Page47=when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, &l3&rAnd shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies\: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble,
Book7Page46=Chapter 20\nWhen thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them\: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. &l2&rAnd it shall be,
Book7Page45=&l20&rAnd those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you. &l21&rAnd thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
Book7Page44=make diligent inquisition\: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; &l19&rThen shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother\: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.
Book7Page43=witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong; &l17&rThen both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days; &l18&rAnd the judges shall
Book7Page42=giveth thee to possess it. &l15&rOne witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth\: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established. &l16&rIf a false
Book7Page41=shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee. &l14&rThou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God
Book7Page40=and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities\: &l12&rThen the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. &l13&rThine eye shall not pity him, but thou
Book3Page50=into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven\: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
Book7Page39=for thee, beside these three\: &l10&rThat innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee. &l11&rBut if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him,
Ch9=B4P36
Book7Page38=and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; &l9&rIf thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more
Ch8=B4P15
Book7Page37=slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. &l7&rWherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. &l8&rAnd if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers,
Ch7=B4P2
Book7Page36=the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live\: &l6&rLest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and
Ch6=B3P33
Book7Page35=which shall flee thither, that he may live\: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past; &l5&rAs when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and
Ch5=B3P19
Book7Page34=the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. &l3&rThou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither. &l4&rAnd this is the case of the slayer,
Ch4=B2P49
Book7Page33=Chapter 19\nWhen the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses; &l2&rThou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which
Ch3=B2P17
Book7Page32=speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously\: thou shalt not be afraid of him.
Ch2=B1P49
Book7Page31=a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die. &l21&rAnd if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken? &l22&rWhen a prophet
Ch1=B1P27
Book7Page30=mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. &l19&rAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. &l20&rBut the prophet, which shall presume to speak
Book3Page49=mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. &l23&rBut the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. &l24&rAnd he shall deliver their kings
Book3Page48=are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed. &l21&rThou shalt not be affrighted at them\: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible. &l22&rAnd the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little\: thou
Book3Page47=wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out\: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid. &l20&rMoreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that
Book3Page46=nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? &l18&rThou shalt not be afraid of them\: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; &l19&rThe great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
Book3Page45=thee. &l16&rAnd thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them\: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. &l17&rIf thou shalt say in thine heart, These
Book3Page44=there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. &l15&rAnd the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate
Book3Page43=bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. &l14&rThou shalt be blessed above all people\:
Book3Page42=shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers\: &l13&rAnd he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee\: he will also
Book3Page41=their face, to destroy them\: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. &l11&rThou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. &l12&rWherefore it
Book3Page40=hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. &l9&rKnow therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; &l10&rAnd repayeth them that hate him to
Book7Page29=neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. &l17&rAnd the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken. &l18&rI will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his
Book7Page28=Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; &l16&rAccording to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God,
Book7Page27=perfect with the LORD thy God. &l14&rFor these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners\: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do. &l15&rThe LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a
Book7Page26=charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. &l12&rFor all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD\: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee. &l13&rThou shalt be
Book7Page25=learn to do after the abominations of those nations. &l10&rThere shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, &l11&rOr a
Book7Page24=all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD. &l8&rThey shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony. &l9&rWhen thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not
Book7Page23=his sons for ever. &l6&rAnd if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose; &l7&rThen he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as
Book7Page22=maw. &l4&rThe firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him. &l5&rFor the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and
Book7Page21=the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them. &l3&rAnd this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the
Book7Page20=Chapter 18\nThe priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel\: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance. &l2&rTherefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren\:
Book3Page39=for ye were the fewest of all people\: &l8&rBut because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the
